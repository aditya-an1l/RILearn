      <p>Hassan's Attendance Problem</p>
    </h1>
    <img src="Screenshot 2025-02-09 003846.png" alt="image">
    <p> For many years now, I have been teaching Computer Science to students
      studying for their Masters in Computer Applications at a college in
      Bangalore. I have interacted with many students, and though it is not possible
      to remember all of them now, the memories of some are etched in my mind.
      That is not because they were all brilliant, but something in them was very
      different from the others.</p>

    <p> In my first batch, there was a very bright boy called Hassan. He was tall,
      handsome with a very good memory. He came from an affluent family where
      he was the only son. Initially I did not come to know of his existence at all,
      mainly because he was hardly ever present. I normally take the first class of
      the day, which is scheduled at 9 a.m. or the one after that at 10 a.m. I prefer
      this time as this is when students are fresh and very attentive.</p>

    <p> Once in a while Hassan would turn up, particularly if there was a class test
      or during examinations. I met him more often for attendance shortage
      meetings. He would beg for attendance in such a manner that it was very
      difficult for me to say 'no'. Sometimes I would get upset and tell him, 'No, I
      can't give you attendance. There should be discipline.'</p>

    <p> 'Yes Madam,' he would reply apologetically, 'pardon me. From the next
      semester onwards I will definitely attend your class. Can you not pardon me
      this time? To err is human, to forgive is divine. You have only taught us this.'</p>

    <p> I could not remain angry for long. Teachers do get upset with students who
      are not regular, but if the attendance shortage affects their appearance in the
      final examination, then one tends to melt like snow against the sun. A good
      teacher will always wish for the best for her student, though I do agree
      discipline is very important too.</p>

    <p> As he was very bright, Hassan would invariably get a first class in the
      exam. However, before the exams started, every semester this drama with
      Hassan would be repeated. I would get upset, threaten and ultimately give in.
      Each time Hassan would promise to improve his attendance record, and for
      one week would attend all classes, then the same old story would follow. Each
      time he had a different reason for his absences. Unfortunately, they always
      seemed genuine to me.</p>

    <p> Once I got tired of his stories and called his parents.
      'Your son is a bright boy, he is not arrogant but he is indisciplined. If only
      he came to class regularly and attended the lab I am sure he can get a rank. I
      have failed to convince him. I will be happy if you could look into the matter
      more seriously, because this is going to affect his life,' I said to them.</p>

    <p> Hassan's father was a busy man and did not take my words very seriously.
      He said, 'As long as he does well that is fine with me because after a certain
      age children do not listen to their parents. Only life will teach them.'</p>

    <p> But his mother was in tears.</p>
    <p> 'Madam, I have failed as a mother. He does not listen to me at all. He
      spends all night listening to music, and chatting with his friends. He sleeps at
      six in the morning. How can he come to any class? He does not pay any
      attention to what I say and tells me I repeat the same thing always.'</p>

    <p> The meeting ended in an argument between his parents. His father said,
      'You are the mother. It is your duty to correct him. You spend more time with
      him. I am so busy. You have failed.'</p>

    <p> His mother said, 'You are the father. It is difficult to control boys. You can
      speak to him man to man. Earning money is not the only thing in life.'</p>

    <p> This continued for a while and the meeting ended fruitlessly. Hassan
      continued in his ways till he passed out of his course, as usual in first class.
      He was a nice boy. He came and thanked me.</p>

    <p> 'Madam, thank you for teaching me for the last three years. Because of
      your kind heart I could get all my attendance. I wish all teachers were like
      you in the college.'</p>

    <p> I laughed. </p>
    <p> 'God willing, we will meet again.' </p>
    <p> But I did not meet Hassan for a long time and forgot all about him. Years
      passed. I taught many students. Some of them became very good human
      beings, some became famous, some became rich and some remained ordinary.
      As far as I was concerned, they were like my children. Some remember me
      still and send invitations to weddings, naming ceremonies, house warmings,
      etc. If I am in town I definitely try and attend, because for me their immense
      love is my strength.</p>

    <p> One Monday morning, my secretary told me a person wanting to sell the
      latest software in high school teaching wanted to meet me. I was extremely
      busy and the piles of unanswered letters were looking at me accusingly. I had
      no time to talk to a sales person. So I told her, 'He can meet someone else. I
      don't have time.'</p>

    <p> But my secretary said he was insisting he wanted to meet only me and that
      he was my student. She knew how fond I was of all my students, so she had
      been unable to say 'no' to him.</p>

    <p> 'In that case let him see me at 2 p.m.'</p>
    <p style="font-family:Monospace" align="center"> In the afternoon, a man of about thirty-five years, plump, with a
      bald head
      and moderately dressed was waiting for me in the office. In his hand was the
      CD with the software. I could not place him though he seemed familiar. He
      smiled at me and said, 'Madam, can you recognize me? You may not, because
      how can you remember all your students? From a window you can see the
      outside world but from the outside you cannot see all that is inside.'</p>

    <p> I liked his analogy and was sure he was my student because I often used
      this phrase in my class. Still I could not guess who he was.
      'Madam, I was the perpetual latecomer of your class.'</p>

    <p> That's when the coin dropped. 'Hi Hassan. How are you? It's been a long
      time since I last met you.' I was very happy to see him.</p>

    <p> 'Madam, I am fine and remember many of your lessons.'</p>

    <p> 'Is it Database Management? Or C? Or Pascal?'
      'None of the software Madam, I remember the moral lessons.'</p>

    <p> I didn't know what moral lessons I had taught, though I do tell some stories
      during my lectures on computer software.</p>

    <p> 'Hassan, what are you doing now?'</p>
    <p style="font-family:Monospace" align="center"> Now his face became a little pale.</p>
    <p style="font-family:Monospace" align="center"> 'Madam, I am selling this software which is useful in teaching
      Maths,
      Physics and Chemistry. It is of help to both teachers and students. I know
      your foundation helps a lot in education at the high school level. I thought it
      may be of some interest to you.'</p>

    <p> 'Hassan, what did you do for so many years?'</p>
    <p style="font-family:Monospace" align="center"> I knew all his classmates by this time were in very high positions
      in the
      software industry. Hassan being a bright student, should have definitely done
      well. Yet, on the contrary, he seemed to be doing a small job of selling high
      school software door-to-door.</p>

    <p> 'Madam, you know I was very irregular in college. The same habit
      continued even after my graduation. I would get up late and was very lazy.
      My mother would lose her temper and peace of mind. I did not bother. I took
      her for granted. After a lot of pressure from my parents I took up a job. But I
      continued with the same habits of going late to office, not keeping
      appointments and not being responsible. I did not have the proper knowledge
      also. In college, I hardly studied. Getting a first class in the examination is not
      an index of the amount of knowledge one has. I would study just before the
      exams, guess the probable questions, and skip the chapters. I always thought I
      could somehow make it later. But without proper knowledge it is difficult to
      work. I always laughed at those people who were hard workers. I used to
      make fun of them and called them "nerds". Today those "nerds" have become
      millionaires. Nobody liked me in my office because of my behaviour. No
      employer would keep such an employee, and I lost whatever job I took up. In
      my frustration I started quarrelling at office as well as at home. Finally my
      father got so fed up he told me to stay separately. He always gave me a lot of
      freedom but I never picked up any good habits. My state today is the result of
      my own habits.'</p>

    <p> I felt sorry for Hassan, who with all his intelligence and good nature, could
      not make it.</p>

    <p> 'Hassan, you knew your faults, you could have improved and made a better
      life for yourself. There is always a start at any age. Don't get disappointed.
      You may have lost a battle but you can still win the war.'
      'Madam, old habits die hard.'</p>

    <p> 'But Hassan it is possible to change your habits. There is nothing which is
      impossible. You only require will power. You are yourself not aware of all
      your potential. Please remember when elders say some thing they do so
      because they want you to lead a better life than them. Excellence does not
      come by accident but by practice.'</p>

    <p> I could see a twinkle in his eyes. I thought I saw a glimpse of the young
      bright Hassan. 'I will try my best, Madam,' he promised, as he rose to leave.</p>

    <p> I have not met Hassan since that day. I hope to bump into him unexpectedly
      once again, and this time find him happy and successful.</p>
