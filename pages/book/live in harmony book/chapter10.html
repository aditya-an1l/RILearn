</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Story:
</p>
<p>Rachel Louise Carson was born in the small, river town of Springdale,
 Pennsylvania, in 1907.  Rachel’s mother was a great lover of nature and living
 things, and so Rachel spent much of her childhood outside in nature and talking
 about the natural world with her mother.  In school, Rachel loved science and she
went on to study science in college. She received a Bachelor’s Degree in Biology
 from Pennsylvania College for Women and a Masters Degree in Zoology from
 John’s Hopkins University.  
</p>
<p>After college, Rachel got a job with the United States Bureau of Fisheries,
 writing radio scripts about nature.  During this time, she also wrote feature arti
cles about natural history for the Baltimore Sun.  She then began a fifteen-year
 career with the federal service as a scientist and editor in l936, and eventually
 rose to become Editor-in-Chief of all publications for the U.S Fish and Wildlife
 Service.  </p>
<p>Rachel continued to write about important topics such as conservation and
 natural resources and edited many scientific articles.  During her free time she
 started writing more creatively, in a style called lyric prose.  She wrote an article
 called Undersea in 1937, and then a book called Under the Sea-Wind in 1941.  In
 1952 she published her prize-winning study of the ocean, The Sea Around Us,
 which was followed by The Edge of the Sea in 1955.  These books were like a
 biography of the ocean and they became very popular.  Rachel Carson became
 famous as a naturalist and science writer for the public.  She resigned her job in
 government service in 1952 to devote herself to writing.</p>
<p> During her career as a writer, Rachel wrote several other articles that were
 intended to teach people about the wonders of the living world.  These articles
 included Help Your Child to Wonder (1956) and Our Ever Changing Shore
 (1957).  She was also planning another book about the ecology of life, but she
 was never able to complete it.  All of Rachel’s writing expressed the philosophy
 that human beings were only one part of nature and that human beings had a
 power that other living things did not have – human beings could either help
 nature or hurt nature.</p>
<p>Around the time of World War II, Rachel became very concerned about the
 widespread use of pesticides around the world and the dangerous impact of chem
icals on the environment, on animals, and on people.  Rachel felt a responsibility
 to warn people that the chemicals in pesticides were very harmful and that some
thing had to be done to protect people and nature from them. In 1962 she wrote a
 book called Silent Spring, in which she spoke out against the practices of agricul
tural scientists and the government.   In this book, Rachel called for a change in
 the way people were viewing and treating the natural world.  </p>
<p>Some people did not like what Rachel was saying, especially the compa
nies that made the chemicals for the pesticides.  Rachel was criticized and some
times ridiculed by the chemical industry and by some members of the govern
ment.  Yet Rachel continued to speak out about what she believed and about what
 her scientific research was showing. She continued to try to teach people to see
 humanity as part of the fabric of nature, and that if we treat nature badly, we will
all suffer in the end.  In 1963 Rachel was called to testify before Congress, and
 during her testimony she pleaded for new policies to protect people and the envi
ronment from dangerous chemicals.</p>
<p> Rachel Carson died from breast cancer in 1964.  Her work lives on in her
 books.  Her life is an inspiration to all of us to try to be more aware of our
 capacity to live more harmoniously with nature.</p>
<p>Chapter Overview: </p>
<p>Living in harmony with Nature is one of our most important jobs as human
 beings.  As Rachel Carson and many others have taught us, we human beings are
 the stewards of the earth.  We have a very important responsibility to treat the
 earth kindly, to use the earth’s resources wisely, and to preserve the beauty and
 health of the earth for the future. Nature herself can provide us with comfort and
 support as we try to live up to our responsibility. When we need guidance, wis
dom, or inspiration, we can go out into nature to play, walk, run, write, paint,
 sing, or just to be.  </p>
<p>There is a great harmony that exists in nature. As creatures that are a part
 of nature, we can enjoy that harmony and that connection every time we go out
 into the forest, to the mountains, to the sea, or just to a local meadow, a park, or
 our back yard.  Nature is one of our most special friends.  It is important that we
 get to know nature’s gifts so we can get help and healing from nature when we
 need it – and so we can support nature when she needs our help.</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 — Mini Vision Quest</p>
<p> If possible, the vision quest should take place in the forest, in the moun
tains, in a meadow, by the sea, near a lake, or in some other natural setting.  If
 your school is not near wilderness, you can go to a local park, a nature center, or
 even to a quiet spot on your playground.  
</p>
<p>Vision quests were and continue to be an important  coming of age cere
mony in many native tribes of North America.  In many Native American tribes, a
 young person in the early teen years goes out into nature and spends some time
 by themselves.  Sometimes they may even spend a night, or even two or three
 nights, alone in the wilderness.  During this time the young person is expected to
 practice the skills of living in the wilderness that they have learned, and they are
 also supposed to spend time in reflection about this important stage of their lives.</p>
<p>Many tribes believe that during the vision quest the young person should
wait until they are visited by an animal or a spirit guide who will give them an
 important message or some kind of wisdom for their personal life or for their
 tribe.  The native people believe that the person on the vision quest may have
 ‘visions’- that they may see things or stories in their mind’s eye, that have impor
tant meanings.  The stories of Black Elk in Black Elk Speaks are good examples
 of these kinds of visions.
</p>
<p> When you do your own vision quests, you will not be staying in the
 wilderness alone for a long time as the young Native Americans do.  You will
 simply go to spend some time in a natural place.  Here are a few guidelines you
 might find helpful for a successful vision quest:
</p>
<p> a) Take the class to a natural place or to a local park.</p>
<p>b) Each student should bring a pen or pencil and a small notebook to write or
 draw in.  A marble composition book is fine, though a smaller, pocket-sized note
book is even better.
</p>
<p>c) Each student should be prepared to be silent for at least 15 minutes.  30 min
utes of silence is ideal.  It might be very helpful to practice being silent in class
 for some minutes each day prior to going on your vision quest.
</p>
<p>d) Once you arrive at your natural location, each student should pick a different
 spot to be. They should select a spot that ‘speaks to them’– a place where they
 will be comfortable and peaceful and not distracted. It is important for each stu
dent to be far enough from other students that they can’t really see them directly
 or at least that they can’t really talk to each other.
</p>
<p>e) During the vision quest everyone should maintain silence.  If someone needs
 the teacher’s attention for some important reason, they can make a signal or a
 motion to the teacher and the teacher can quietly come over to the student.</p>
<p> f) The teacher’s job is to walk around quietly and unobtrusively, to make sure
 everyone is safe and focused.  If everything is going as planned the teacher can sit
 in a central place and enjoy nature too!
</p>
<p> g) Each person should be encouraged to pay attention to the things of nature that
 surround them – especially the small things.  Look and listen to the sights and
 sounds of nature – the songs of the birds, the rush of the water, the insects on the
 ground, the flowers, the ferns, the grass and the trees.</p>
<p>h) Each student should be encouraged to listen with their inner ears and to look
 with their mind’s eye during their vision quest.  If they do, they very likely will
 get a message or an image that they want to write down or draw in their note
books.
</p>
<p> i) Sometimes it is best to advise the students to wait until they get back to class to
 share about their vision quests.  This gives each person time to think about and
 absorb their own experience.</p>
 <p>j) Once back at school, invite students to share about their vision quests if they
 want to.  Students should also be invited to write more in-depth journal entries or
 more detailed pictures once they are back in class.  This will make their overall
 experience much deeper and more memorable. Enjoy your vision quest!</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2 — Making and using talking sticks</p>
<p> A‘talking stick’ is a valuable tool in talking about feelings.  Find a stick in
 the forest or in the park. Break off any small twigs or branches and use some
 sandpaper to take the bark off and make it smooth. Then, using craft glue or hot
 glue, attach feathers, stones, shells, yarn, polished glass, dried flowers or other
 natural objects to your stick. Remember that your stick is going to help you to
 share your feelings with others, so your stick should have a special design that is
 just yours. Once your stick is finished, you can use it when you need to speak
 your feelings with others.  Simply hold the stick when you are speaking. Give the
 stick to your partner when you are finished.  Whoever is not holding the stick has
 the job of listening with ‘giraffe ears’ (see Chapter 3). Good luck! (You can use a
 talking stick in the same way you use the harmony flower described in Chapter
 3.)</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #3 — Making a God’s Eye</p>
<p> Nobody really knows the origin of the ‘God’s Eye.’ ‘God’s Eye’ is the
 name given to a certain artistic, geometric design, which is described below.
 Nature is full of geometric forms, from snowflakes to crystals and from atoms to
 nebulae.  Making a ‘God’s Eye’ can remind us of nature’s many beautiful designs. </p>
<p>Materials:  Two sticks of equal length: anything from toothpicks to popsicle sticks
 to branches or dowels)
 Yarn:  embroidery floss, or cotton or wool yarn (several different colors)
 Decorations:  feathers, beads, seeds, bells, etc</p>
<p>a) Cross the sticks at the center, and tie together with the end of one piece of
 yarn.  Tie the yarn in the back.</p>
<p> b) Wind the yarn around the intersection in a figure eight or in any other pattern
 that will secure the center.</p>
<p>c) Then begin weaving by winding the yarn behind and then over one stick,
 behind and over the next stick, until you are ready to change colors.</p>
<p> d) Then tie on a second color and continue weaving around the sticks. You may
 add several colors, and you can reverse the direction of the weaving to make
 more complex weaving patterns.</p>
<p> e) Stop before you have filled the sticks completely and knot the yarn on the
 back.  (Remember to make all knots on the reverse side when changing colors.)</p>
 <p> f) Attach feathers, bells, beads, etc. by tying them to the ends of the sticks.</p>
 <p> g) Some color meanings: Yellow: Sun, Moon, Stars</p>
 <p> Blue:Sky and Water</p>
 <p> Brown: Earth</p>
 <p>Green:
 Plant Life</p>
 <p>Black:
Death and Transformation</p>
 <p> Red:
 Life</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson #4 — Sand painting </p>
 <p>Sand painting is very popular in different cultures around the world,
 including the Navajo culture in the Southwestern United States and the Buddhist
 culture of Tibet (near China).  Sand paintings are usually made of colored sand
 and the designs are usually symbols of life, renewal, energy, or other inspiring
 things.  Traditional sand paintings are often made by simply pouring or dropping
 sand on a certain kind of paper or smooth surface.  Quite often the sand is not
 fixed to the surface in any way – so it can be brushed or whisked away when the
 sand painting and whatever ceremony it might be used for are finished.  This
 brushing or whisking away symbolizes the impermanence of all things and the
 constant change occurring in the universe. It also helps us to appreciate the
 process of creation, to live in the moment, and to learn how to let go of the past.</p>
 <p> If you wish, you can make “impermanent” sand paintings as the native
 people do.  You can also make sand paintings that are more permanent which you
 can keep.  To do this, follow the directions below.</p>
 <p>a) You need some solid art paper – either poster board, card stock, watercolor
 paper, or other heavier grade art paper.  You can also use cardboard, but do not try
 to use regular copy paper or other thin paper. You will also need colored sand,
 which you can get at a local art store or craft store</p>
 <p> b) It is best if the sheets of paper are at least 18” by 12” in size.  Even larger
 sheets of paper are better if that is possible.  </p>
 <p>c) The first step is to think about your image or picture and to sketch it first on
 another paper – a piece of scrap paper.  Usually sand paintings are either scenes
 from nature or geometric designs.  Sometimes they also show a simple image of
 certain mythological creatures.  You might want to look at a book of nature
 scenes, a book of mandala designs (from Tibet), or a book of native symbols, if
 you want to get more specific ideas.  You can also come up with your own ideas.
 However, it is important to make your design simple.</p>
 <p>d) Once you have chosen a design or image, and once you have practiced it on a
 piece of scrap paper, you can copy your design onto your final art paper using a
 pencil. You might want to press down lightly with your pencil in case you want to
 erase something.</p>
 <p> e) After you have sketched your design or image, you can decide what colors
 each part of your painting will be. Be sure you know what sand colors you have
 available.  It is best not to try to mix colors and it is also easier if you try not to
 create too many tiny or thin spaces with different colors – at least when you are
 doing your first sand painting.  With your pencil you should very lightly write the
 colors you want to put on the different sections of your drawing.  In other words
 you will write the words ‘blue,’ ‘green,’ and so on, in every section where there
 will be a different color.  Every section should have a note about what color of
 sand you want to put there.  You can use abbreviations if you don’t want to write
 the whole word.</p>
 <p> f) Now the fun part!  Get some Elmer’s glue and carefully drip just enough of it
 on only one section of your painting.  Gently spread the glue evenly across the
 whole section using your finger or a q-tip cotton stick.   Be sure the whole section
 is covered, but only do one section.  If some glue spills or leaks over to another
 section just wipe it off gently with a tissue or napkin before it dries</p>
 <p> g) After you have a nice, smooth spread of glue over one section you can careful
ly pour the color of sand you want onto that section.  For this you can use a paper
 cup or a small pitcher.  Your sand will stick to the glue automatically.  Just keep
pouring it until the sand is spread across the whole section.  If you have to lift up
 your picture</p>
 <p> h) You must let your first section dry for at least a few minutes before you spread
 your glue for the second section.  In the meantime, you can save any extra sand
 by shaking it off onto your table and using a small whiskbroom to put it back into
 your cup or pitcher</p>
 <p> i) Just don’t be in too much of a hurry, and you will end up with a beautiful sand
 painting.  (Note: It may take more than one sitting or class to finish).</p>
 <p>j) You can make a display for your sand paintings when your class is finished.  It
 is always good to include labels for each painting and a written, posted descrip
tion of the project to put on the bulletin board with your paintings.  Good luck!</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson #5 — Making dream catchers</p>
 <p> ‘Dream catchers’ are an important part of the culture of some Native
 American tribes.  Dream catchers have also become a very popular item in
 today’s modern world as well.  The belief or idea behind the dream catcher is that
 the web of the dream catcher catches bad dreams or negative thoughts, while it
 lets good dreams and positive thoughts pass through.  Good dreams or positive
 thoughts are dreams and thoughts that are fulfilling and enriching, that bring us
 greater peace and happiness.  The dreams or thoughts that get caught in the web
 are all those things that don’t help us on our journey; things that might block us
 or limit us from reaching our personal harmony.  You can learn how to make a
 dream catcher, and then you can hang your dream catcher in your classroom or in
 your house to bring more harmony into your life.</p>
 <p> a) Use about 2-6 feet of soaked vines (willow or grapevine preferably).  Carefully
 bend the vine around to form a circle with a 3 - 8 inch diameter.  (Usually dream
catchers are no wider than an adult’s hand.)</p>
 <p>b) Twist the vine around the circle to strengthen the hoop.</p>
 <p> c) Use about 4-16 feet of strong, thin string (hemp, jute, or any natural fiber).
 Knot a loop in one end. This will become the hanger.</p>
 <p>d) Tie the hanging loop around the weakest point.</p>
 <p> e) Hold the string and place it loosely over the top of the loop.  Move the string
 around to the back of the hoop (making a hole) and pull the string back through
 the hole. Repeat this stitch all around the loop, progressively making a smaller
 and smaller opening.</p>
 <p> f) Pull each stitch taut, but not too tight, so that it will lie flat. Space the stitches
 evenly, about 1 and 1/2 to 2 inches apart.</p>
 <p>g) On the following rounds, place the string around the center of each stitch from
 the previous round.</p>
 <p> h) As you work through the rounds, the string from the previous rounds should
 bend towards the center of the hoop slightly.  A spider web begins to form.</p>
 <p> i) You can place a bead on the string to represent the spider.</p>
 <p> j) Make sure you leave a hole in the center of the dream catcher.</p>
 <p> k) End by stitching twice in the same place, forming a knot, and pull tight.</p>
 <p> l) You have completed your dream catcher.  Find a place to hang it at school or at
 home and enjoy sweet dreams and pleasant thoughts.</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson # 6 —Nature poem/Circle game</p>
 <p> For this game you will need some special things that you have found in
 nature – some small stones, some shells, some chestnuts, black walnuts in their
 green shells, or some other roundish natural objects.  You can use apples, oranges,
 or ordinary balls if you wish.  It is quite possible that a few objects will be
 dropped and lost to the game, so plan accordingly.  You should have enough items
 of the same object, all stones or all shells, for example, so everyone in the circle
 will have one.</p>
 <p>a) For this game, stand in a circle with just enough distance between each person
 so that everyone can touch hands.  During this game you don’t actually hold
 hands, but you gently touch each other’s hands by holding your left palm upward
 and your right palm downward.  Eventually you will be receiving an object in
your left hand from the person to your left and you will be passing the object on
 to the person to your right with your right hand.
 b) You begin the game, however, with each person holding their object in their
 own two hands in front of their invisible heart – the left hand palm up and the
 right hand palm down.  In other words, the object will be sitting in the left palm
 and it will be covered gently by the right hand.</p>
 <p> c) You will stand still during this game.  The only motion is with your hands and
 arms.  Basically there are only two motions.  In one motion you are moving your
 hands towards your neighbors’ hands on your left and right.   In the other motion,
 you are moving your hands back to the middle of your chest, as described above.
 First you will receive an object in your left hand, then you will move your hands
 to the middle of your chest, and then you will pass the object to the person on the
 right.  </p>
 <p>d) It is important to keep a steady rhythm. Otherwise folks will not pass at the
 same time.  In other words, everyone in the circle needs to do the actions in uni
son – that is the object of the game. If you think of each motion described above
 as having one drumbeat, this will help you to ‘get it.’</p>
 <p> e) There is a poem that goes with the game.  Wherever you see the slash (‘/’) in
 the poem, that is where your hands are coming to the center. Whenever you are
 saying the words of the poem, that is where you are receiving or giving the
 object.  It is important to pause briefly after every motion – after every part of the
 poem.  Each part of the poem goes with one beat. Here is the poem:</p>
 <p> We give / we care</p>
 <p> We learn / to share</p>
 <p> And as / we give</p>
 <p>We learn / to weave</p>
 <p>Aweb / of love </p>
 <p>As bright /as stars</p>
 <p> That shine / above</p>
 <p> f) When you are done with the game, you can talk about the game – what was
 challenging and what was fun.  You can also talk about the meaning of the poem.
 This poem is borrowed from the Rudolph Steiner educational program – also
 called the Waldorf educational approach.</p>
 <p> g) You may find it very helpful to practice this game without any objects first, so
 you can learn the motions, the proper rhythm, and the words to the poem.</p>
 <p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
 <p> a) Compare the two meanings of  ‘nature.’ One meaning is Mother Earth and all
 of her manifestations.  The other meaning means the essence of being human.
 Can you find one quotation from the chapter quotations above that uses ‘nature’
 in the first way and another quotation that uses ‘nature’ in the second way?  How
 do you think these two kinds of nature are connected?  Brainstorm the different
 ways – there is not just one ‘right’ answer!</p>
 <p> b) Chief Seattle was a great Native American Chief.  He was an eloquent speaker.
 One of his speeches was written down by people who attended the occasion
 (there were no recording devices back then!).  This speech was about the end of
 the way of life of the Native Americans and the beginning of the ‘white man’s’
 control of North America.   The speech is also about the different ways of seeing
 and treating Mother Earth.  This speech became very famous. You can find this
 famous Chief Seattle speech about Mother Earth in the encyclopedia, in many
 books, or on the Internet.  Read all or part of this speech with your class. If it is
 too long for one person to read the whole thing, each person can read part of it.
 Discuss the meaning of this important speech with your class.</p>
 <p> c) Frank Lloyd Wright was a very famous American architect and philosopher.
 Discuss what you think he meant in quotation #2.</p>
 <p class="side">Supplemental Activities:</p>
 <p>Make a seed collection.  See how many different kinds of seeds you can collect.
 You can paste them onto paper or put them into containers with compartments.  It
 will be good to label your seeds, if you can identify them.  You can also try to
 sketch them on some art paper or in a science journal.  You can also sketch what
 the seeds will sprout into and what they will become as adults.  Discuss with your
 class what it is inside the seed that determines what kind of plant it will become.
 Is it the same for humans?  What is it inside you that shapes what kind of body
 shape and size and color you will become?  What is it that shapes what kind of
 person you will become? </p>
