    <h3>
      <p>What is your reason for being?</p>
    </h3>
    <p>
      According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—what a French philosopher
      might call a raison d'être. Some people have found their ikigai, while others are
      still looking, though they carry it within them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our ikigai is hidden deep inside each of us, and finding it requires a patient
      search. According to those born on Okinawa, the island with the most centenarians in the world, our ikigai is
      the reason we get up in the morning.
    </p>
    <img src="Screenshot 2025-02-09 112337.png" alt="image">

    <h3>
      <p>Whatever you do, don't retire!</p>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Having a clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to our
      lives. The purpose of this book is to help you find yours, and to share insights
      from Japanese philosophy on the lasting health of body, mind, and spirit.
    </P>

    <p>
      One surprising thing you notice, living in Japan, is how active people remain
      after they retire. In fact, many Japanese people never really retire—they keep
      doing what they love for as long as their health allows.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is, in fact, no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of "leaving
      the workforce for good" as in English. According to Dan Buettner, a National
      Geographic reporter who knows the country well, having a purpose in life is so
      important in Japanese culture that our idea of retirement simply doesn't exist
      there.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <p>The island of (almost) eternal youth</p>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Certain longevity studies suggest that a strong sense of community and a clearly
      defined ikigai are just as important as the famously healthful Japanese diet—
      perhaps even more so. Recent medical studies of centenarians from Okinawa and
      other so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions where people live longest—
      provide a number of interesting facts about these extraordinary human beings:

            <p>Ikaria, Greece. One of every three inhabitants of this island near the coast of
              Turkey is over ninety years old (compared to less than 1 percent of the
              population of the United States), a fact that has earned it the nickname the
              Island of Long Life. The local secret seems to be a lifestyle that dates back to
              500 BC.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Many of these centenarians enjoy enviable levels of vitality and health that

      <b>The Characters Behind Ikigai</b><br>
      In Japanese, ikigai is written as 生き甲斐, combining 生き, which means
      "life," with 甲斐, which means "to be worthwhile." 甲斐 can be broken
      down into the characters 甲, which means "armor," "number one," and "to
      be the first" (to head into battle, taking initiative as a leader), and 斐,
      which means "beautiful" or "elegant."
    </p>


    <p>
      Though we will consider each of these findings over the course of the book,
      research clearly indicates that the Okinawans' focus on ikigai gives a sense of
      purpose to each and every day and plays an important role in their health and
      longevity
    </p>

    <h3>
      <p>The five Blue Zones</p>
    </h3>
    <p>Okinawa holds first place among the world's Blue Zones. In Okinawa, women in
      particular live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world.
      The five regions identified and analyzed by Dan Buettner in his book The Blue
      Zones are:</p>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Okinawa, Japan (especially the northern part of the island). The locals eat a
          diet rich in vegetables and tofu typically served on small plates. In addition to
          their philosophy of ikigai, the moai, or close-knit group of friends (see page
          15), plays an important role in their longevity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Sardinia, Italy (specifically the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra). Locals on
          this island consume plenty of vegetables and one or two glasses of wine per
          day. As in Okinawa, the cohesive nature of this community is another factor
          directly related to longevity.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Loma Linda, California. Researchers studied a group of Seventh-day
          Adventists who are among the longest-living people in the United States.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. Locals remain remarkably active after
          ninety; many of the region's older residents have no problem getting up at
          five thirty in the morning to work in the fields.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Ikaria, Greece. One of every three inhabitants of this island near the coast of
          Turkey is over ninety years old (compared to less than 1 percent of the
          population of the United States), a fact that has earned it the nickname the
          Island of Long Life. The local secret seems to be a lifestyle that dates back to
          500 BC.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the
      keys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to
      Okinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth
      pointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce
      and communities have to help one another.
    </p>

    <p>
      For many, helping others might be an ikigai strong enough to keep them alive.
      According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to
      longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming
      strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family
      relations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce
      stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.

      They don't do strenuous exercise, but they do move every day, taking walks
      and working in their vegetable gardens. People in the Blue Zones would rather
      walk than drive. Gardening, which involves daily low-intensity movement, is a
      practice almost all of them have in common.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <p>The 80 percent secret</p>
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the most common sayings in Japan is "Hara hachi bu," which is repeated
      before or after eating and means something like "Fill your belly to 80 percent."
      Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans
      stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity,
      rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive
      processes that accelerate cellular oxidation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80
      percent capacity. The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating
      when we are starting to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we
      know in our hearts we don't really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these will give us pleasure in the
      short term, but not having them will make us happier in
      the long term.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many
      small plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan
      is served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish
      slightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are
      going to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling
      slightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose
      weight and stay trim.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average
      of 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and
      have a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United
      States.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <p>Moai: Connected for life</p>
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai
      is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one
      another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.
    </p>

    <p>
      The moai has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to
      share best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests.
      Members of a moai make a set monthly contribution to the group. This
      payment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and shogi
      (Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common.
    </p>

    <p>
      The funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money
      left over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from
      the surplus. In this way, being part of a moai helps maintain emotional and
      financial stability. If a member of a moai is in financial trouble, he or she can get
      an advance from the group's savings. While the details of each moai's accounting
      practices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of
      belonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase
      life expectancy.
    </p>

    <p>
      FOLLOWING THIS BRIEF introduction to the topics covered in this book, we look at
      a few causes of premature aging in modern life, and then explore different
      factors related to ikigai.
