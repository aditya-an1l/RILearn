      <p>Four</p>
    </h1>
    <p>THE rains set in, and the sun only made brief appearances. The hills
turned a lush green. Ferns sprang up on walls and tree-trunks. Giant
lilies reared up like leopards from the tall grass. A white mist coiled
and uncoiled as it floated up from the valley. It was a beautiful season,
except for the leeches.
</p>
<p>Every day, Binya came home with a couple of leeches fastened to the
flesh of her bare legs. They fell off by themselves just as soon as they’d had
their thimbleful of blood; but you didn’t know they were on you until they
fell off; and then, later, the skin became very sore and itchy. Some of the
older people still believed that to be bled by leeches was a remedy for
various ailments. Whenever Ram Bharosa had a headache, he applied a
leech to his throbbing temple.
</p>
<p>Three days of incessant rain had flooded out a number of small animals
who lived in holes in the ground. Binya’s mother suddenly found the roof
full of field-rats. She had to drive them out; they ate too much of her storedup wheat flour and rice. Bijju liked lifting up large rocks, to disturb the
scorpions who were sleeping beneath. And snakes came out to bask in the
sun.
</p>
<p>Binya had just crossed the small stream at the bottom of the hill when
she saw something gliding out of the bushes and coming towards her. It was
a long black snake. A clatter of loose stones frightened it. Seeing the girl in
its way, it rose up, hissing, prepared to strike. The forked tongue darted out,
the venomous head lunged at Binya.
</p>
<p>Binya’s umbrella was open as usual. She thrust it forward, between
herself and the snake, and the snake’s hard snout thudded twice against the
strong silk of the umbrella. The reptile then turned and slithered away over
the wet rocks, disappearing in a clump of ferns.
</p>
<p>Binya forgot about the cow’s and ran all the way home to tell her
mother how she had been saved by the umbrella. Bijju had to put away his
books and go out to fetch the cows. He carried a stout stick, in case he met
with any snakes.</p>
<p>First the summer sun, and now the endless rain, meant that the umbrella
was beginning to fade a little. From a bright blue it had changed to a light
blue. But it was still a pretty thing, and tougher than it looked, and Ram
Bharosa still desired it. He did not want to sell it; he wanted to own it. He
was probably the richest man in the area—so why shouldn’t he have a blue
umbrella? Not a day passed without his getting a glimpse of Binya and the
umbrella; and the more he saw the umbrella, the more he wanted it.</p>
<p>The schools closed during the monsoon, but this didn’t mean that Bijju
could sit at home doing nothing. Neelu and Gori were providing more milk
than was required at home, so Binya’s mother was able to sell a kilo of milk
every day: half a kilo to the schoolmaster, and half a kilo (at reduced rate)
to the temple Pujari. Bijju had to deliver the milk every morning.
</p>
<p>Ram Bharosa had asked Bijju to work in his shop during the holidays,
but Bijju didn’t have time; he had to help his mother with the ploughing and
the transplanting of the rice-seedlings. So Ram Bharosa employed a boy
from the next village, a boy called Rajaram. He did all the washing-up, and
ran various errands. He went to the same school as Bijju, but the two boys
were not friends.
</p>
<p>One day, as Binya passed the shop, twirling her blue umbrella, Rajaram
noticed that his employer gave a deep sigh and began muttering to himself</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Babuji?” asked the boy</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing,” said Ram Bharosa. “It’s just a sickness that has come
upon me. And it’s all due to that girl Binya and her wretched umbrella.”
</p>
<p>“Why, what has she done to you?”
</p>
<p>“Refused to sell me her umbrella! There’s pride for you. And I offered
her ten rupees.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, if you gave her twelve …”</p>
<p>“But it isn’t new any longer. It isn’t worth eight rupees now. All the
same, I’d like to have it.”
</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t make a profit on it,” said Rajaram</p>
<p>“It’s not the profit I’m after, wretch! It’s the thing itself. It’s the beauty
of it!”</p>
<p>“And what would you do with it, Babuji? You don’t visit anyone—
you’re seldom out of your shop. Of what use would it be to you?”
</p>
<p>“Of what use is a poppy in a cornfield? Of what use is a rainbow? Of
what use are you, numbskull? Wretch! I, too, have a soul. I want the
umbrella, because—because I want its beauty to be mine!”
</p>
<p>Rajaram put the kettle on to boil, began dusting the counter, all the time
muttering: “I’m as useful as an umbrella,” and then, after a short period of
intense thought, said: “What will you give me, Babuji, if i get the umbrella
for you?”
</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked the old man.
</p>
<p>“You know what i mean. What will you give me?”</p>
<p>“You mean to steal it, don’t you, you wretch? What a delightful child
you are! I’m glad you’re not my son or my enemy. But look—everyone will
know it has been stolen, and then how will I be able to show off with it?”</p>
<p>“You will have to gaze upon it in secret,” said Rajaram with a chuckle.</p>
<p>“Or take it into Tehri, and have it coloured red! That’s your problem. But
tell me, Babuji, do you want it badly enough to pay me three rupees for
stealing it without being seen?”
</p>
<p>Ram Bharosa gave the boy a long, sad look. ‘You’re a sharp boy,” he
said. “You’ll come to a bad end. I’ll give you two rupees.”
</p>
<p>“Three,” said the boy.</p>
<p>“Two,” said the old man.</p>
<p>“You don’t really want it, i can see that,” said the boy</p>
<p>“Wretch!” said the old man. “Evil one! Darkener of my doorstep! Fetch
me the umbrella, and I’ll give you three rupees.”</p>
