      <p>Chapter Four</p>
      <p>  The Good Things about Ourselves – Our Virtues</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="side"> Chapter Inspiration: </p>
<p>“One path alone leads to a life of peace: the path of virtue.”
 —Juvenal
</p>
<p>“From virtue comes every other good of man.” –Socrates
</p>
<p> “ Recommend to your children virtue; that alone can make them happy.” –Ludwig van Beethoven
</p>
<p> “The very nature of kindness is to spread.
 If you are kind to others, today they will be kind to you,
 And tomorrow to somebody else.”  —Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p> “Alarge part of virtue consists in good habits.” –William Paley</p>
<p> “Is virtue a thing remote?  I wish to be virtuous, and lo, virtue is at hand.” 
—Confucius
</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Story:
</p>
<p> Harriet Tubman was born into slavery in 1820.  Her parents were brought
 to the United States in chains. They were members of the Ashanti nation – a war
rior nation in West Africa.
</p>
<p>When Harriet was only five, she was rented out as a worker, and for the
 next 25 years she lived in slavery.  Harriet often worked with the male slaves, cut
ting wood and doing other kinds of hard labor.  She was strong, and by the age of
 29, she had had more than enough of slavery. She lived only ninety miles from
 freedom.  When she learned that she had been sold, and was going to be sent to
 the deep South, she decided to attempt an escape.  She was told of a local white
 woman who helped runaways, and this woman helped her by giving her two slips
 of paper, each containing the name of a family who would help her on the road
 northward. Her trip was successful.  Over the next eleven years, Harriet made
nineteen trips back into slave-holding territory, to help others escape through the
 Underground Railway.  She brought more than 300 slaves to freedom, risking her
 life for every one of them.  </p>
<p>Harriet was a deeply spiritual woman.  She knew that God was protecting
 her, and she remained courageous, believing that she ventured only where God
 sent her.  She often had prophetic dreams about the future.  Harriet Tubman lived
 and died without material wealth, yet she possessed the unlimited wealth of the
 spirit.  She lectured against slavery throughout the North.  During the Civil War,
 she worked as a spy going deep into the South to gather information on the Con
federate army’s movements.  She led a platoon of black soldiers in three steam
powered gunboats on a mission which freed 800 slaves.  After that, she worked
 tirelessly as a nurse, and when the Civil War was over in 1865, she joined the
 Women’s Rights movement.  She died in 1913 at the age of 93.
</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Overview:
</p>
<p>Avirtue is a positive quality or attribute that we have inside of us. It is like
 a variety or a type of goodness, for example, courage, energy, or patience.  We
 can’t see a virtue but we can see the expression of virtues.  For example, we can’t
 see kindness inside someone, but we can see someone helping a friend when they
 fall down on the playground.  We all have different virtues to share.  Some of us
 have a lot of ambition, while others are very honest. 
</p>
<p>If we want to have more virtues we can learn about them and try to prac
tice them.  Virtues live inside our invisible hearts.  They make each one of us
 very special, because they are like gifts that we have.  We can share our gifts,
 share our virtues, with the world, and we can help others to gain more virtues.
 When we share our virtues we can make the world a happier and more harmo
nious place.  There is no end to the virtues we can gain and practice.  Everybody
 has virtues.  Some people have had a longer time to learn and practice virtues.
 When people have learned and practiced virtues for a long time, they can become
 leaders who help to guide others about virtues.</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 – Kindness</p>
<p>Kindness is about helping others.  Kindness means we open our hearts.
 Kindness means imagining what it is like for someone else. </p>
<p>Think of one kind thing that you have seen this week. Share that with the
 class. Who was being kind? How did that person show their kindness? Were they
 being kind to you or to someone else? </p>
<p>Now think of one act of kindness that you did in your life.  What kind
 thing did you do? How did you help someone or how did it make someone feel?</p>
<p>Using our imagination can be a big help when we are trying to be kind.
 Think of someone you know who might need help. Who is it that might need
 your help? What kind of help do you think they might need?  Next, think of one
 kind thing that you can do today, or later this week, to help that person.  If you
 cannot help that person yourself, then maybe you can talk to someone else who
 can help that person instead. </p>
<p>Write in your journal or diary about kindness.</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #2 — Honesty</p>
<p> Honesty means telling the truth. It also means telling others how you really
 feel.  Sometimes telling the truth can be scary because we think we might get into
 trouble or hurt someone’s feelings.  Do you try to tell the truth? Can you think of
 a time when you did not tell the truth?  Why didn’t you want to tell the truth?
 What happened when you didn’t tell the truth? Most often, if we don’t tell the
 truth, the situation becomes worse and we have more problems than before. 
</p>
<p>Can you also think of a time when you did tell the truth, even though it
 might have been hard or scary?  What happened when you told the truth?  Did
 you feel better? It is not easy to be honest and tell the truth, but if we practice, we
 can make it into a positive habit.  There is an old aphorism that says: “Honesty is
 the best policy.”  To be honest is to be wise, because being honest can save us a
 lot of trouble.  Being honest is also an important virtue to practice because it is a
 major part of being a good person.</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #3 – Courage
</p>
<p> Courage means following your conscience – that little voice inside of you
 that tells you what is right and what is wrong. Courage means standing up for fair
ness and justice. It means speaking out for what you feel is right even if others are
 telling you something different. Courage means not being afraid to be different.
 Courage happens in different ways. Harriet Tubman had courage because she risked
 her life to help others.  Modern Superheroes, and heroes from ancient myths and
 stories, show courage because they solve big problems and bring freedom and safe
ty to kingdoms or whole lands.</p>
<p>Yet courage is something that everyone can practice.   Courage is a virtue
 that helps us to be good citizens and to improve our community and our world. With
 your class share stories about courage that you know or that you have heard.  They
 can be stories about any kind of courage, but it is good to have stories showing the
 different kinds of courage.  Write about your favorite story that was shared in class.
</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #4 – Forgiveness
</p>
<p> Forgiveness means letting go of bad feelings we might have about another
 person. Maybe someone has pushed us down on the playground or has hurt our
 feelings by telling us that they won’t be our friend anymore. It is important to tell
 them how we feel when this happens – to tell them we are sad or hurt that they
 did what they did.  Then, once we talk to the person about what happened, and
 once they acknowledge what they did by saying they are sorry, then we can prac
tice forgiveness.   Forgiveness means being willing to forget what happened and
 to make a fresh start with the person.  </p>
<p>It is easier to practice forgiveness if we remember that everybody makes
 mistakes, and if we recall a mistake that we ourselves have made recently.  We all
 make mistakes.  Mistakes are an important part of life.  They help us to learn and
 to grow into better people.  So forgiveness helps us to move past mistakes into
 learning and growth.  
</p>
<p>Think of a situation in the past or the present that could be an opportunity
 to practice forgiveness.  What is the thing that happened to you? Did you talk
 about your feelings with that person, or did that person already apologize?  If one
 or both of these things has already happened, then you can move to the step of
 forgiveness.  If you want to, you can even say to the person, “I forgive you for
 what you did.”  This sends a clear and powerful message to the person that you
 care enough about your friendship to let go of the past and move on to the future
 together. Make a cartoon about a situation between two people who practice for
giveness.
</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #5 — Gratitude
</p>
<p>Gratitude is like saying ‘thank you,’ for the things that are special to us, the
 things that make us feel happy, the things that make us who we are.  We can express
 gratitude by saying ‘thank you,’ directly to the people we love or to someone who
 has given us something special.  We can say ‘thank you’ to God or to the universe
 for the good things we have in our life.  Or, you can say ‘thank you,’ just to your
self for being you!  We have many gifts in our lives, if we just think about it.  Gifts
can be special people, things that are precious to us, good feelings or even new
 ideas. </p>
<p>Can you name one or two of the gifts you are grateful for in your life?  Share
 one of them with the class.  Make a list of all the things you are grateful for.  Watch
 out!  It might become a pretty long list.  Then decorate your list with some art mate
rials to make a beautiful memento of your gratitude lesson. You can hang it on your
 wall at home or give it to someone special in your life.  Gratitude is a special virtue
 to practice because it can help us to gain appreciation for the gifts in our lives.   If
 we practice gratitude each day it can also help us to develop our other virtues  
especially contentment. 
</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #6 – Determination</p>
<p> Determination means never giving up. Sometimes we have to try to do
 something many times before we can do it. Determination also means working for
 something continually over a long period of time in order to reach a goal.  When
 we want to learn something new or achieve something special we have to try very
 hard and to practice in order to do that thing. When we have determination and
 we finally accomplish that special thing, we get a deep feeling of satisfaction.
 Satisfaction is like a deep happiness or thrill inside of us.  We need determination
 to learn new things, and to grow in our lives.  Can you think of a time when you
 showed determination? Can you think of someone special in your life or someone
 from history who showed determination?
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #7 – Contentment</p>
<p> Contentment means being happy right now with who you are and what you
 have. Siddhartha Gautama Buddha was a great leader who taught that contentment
 is a very helpful virtue to practice if you want to have a happy life. When you look
 at a statue of Buddha, he always looks very content. </p>
 <p>Close your eyes for a few moments and just feel contentment right here and
 right now.  Just take a few breaths and be happy inside yourself.  You have every
thing inside you that you need to be happy.  If you get a new toy or a new game,
 you might get excited, but then once you get used to it, you might not feel as excit
ed.  You might even want to get another toy at that point.  But contentment you can
 always have, no matter what. You don’t need to get anything new or have anything
 more, you can just close your eyes and feel contentment. When you get new toys it
 is natural to have fun with them.  You can enjoy contentment all the time, whether
 you get a new toy or not. Draw a picture of yourself feeling contentment or write a
 poem about contentment. </p>
 <p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
 <p> a) Talk with your class about quotation #1.  Why do you think Juvenal says that
 virtue is the only path to peace?  What do people have to have inside of them in
 order to be peaceful and to spread harmony in the world?</p>
 <p> b) In quotation #2 Socrates says that all other good things come to us if we prac
tice virtues, and in quotation #3 Beethoven says that learning virtues is the only
 way to be happy.  How do you think practicing virtues might help you to gain
 happiness?  What kinds of good things might happen if you practice your virtues
 every day and every week?</p>
 <p> c) In quotation #6 Confucius tells us that practicing virtues is easy once you
 decide to do it. In fact, he says that if we decide to practice virtues then we are
 already a better person. Have you decided to try to practice virtues? Can you
 share what virtues you have noticed classmates, teachers, other school workers,
 your parents, or your grandparents practicing? </p>
 <p class="side">Supplemental Activities:</p>
 <ul>
  <li> <p>With your class, make a list of all the virtues you can think of. Remember that
 virtues are positive qualities that make us good and decent human beings.  You
 can make the virtues into a class mural for display on the wall or the bulletin
 board</p></li>
 <li> <p>Fables, fairy tales and other stories are great ways to learn about virtues and to
 remember to practice them.  With your teacher’s help, find stories that teach les
sons about virtues and share them with the class.</p> </li>
<li> <p> Once you have heard several stories about virtues, why not write your own?
 You can make it a fable, a fairy tale, a myth, a real life story or anything else you
 want.  Just make sure you first decide what virtue your story is going to teach
 about.</p></li>
 <li> <p>Which virtue are you going to start practicing first?  Maybe if you write it
 down on a note card and decorate your note card, it will help you to remember
 the virtue you are practicing.  You can do the same for all the virtues you have
 studied and want to practice.</p></li>
