    <p class="side"> Chapter Inspiration: </p>
<p>“Running ultra-distance races has given me a wealth of first-hand experience of
 God’s compassion. On my own, attempting to run such long distances, I would be
 nowhere, but when God’s grace descends, I am able to complete the distance.”–Suprabha Beckjord
</p>
<p> “Challenge the fear of trying.  You will succeed.” –Sri Chinmoy
</p>
<p> “Health is not simply the absence of sickness.” –Hannah Green
</p>
<p> “Laughter is by definition healthy.”  —Doris Lessing</p>
<p> “Sleep is the golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.”  —Thomas
 Dekker</p>
<p> “Happiness gives us energy which is the basis of health.” –Adele Davis
</p>
<p>“By health I mean the power to live a full, adult, living, breathing life in close
 contact with... the earth and the wonders thereof— the sea – the sun.” —Kather
ine Mansfield
</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Story: 
</p>
<p> Suprabha Beckjord (1956-      ) was born and grew up in Washington, DC.
 Today Suprabha is one of the greatest runners in the world.  Suprabha is not
 known for the speed of her running, but rather for her endurance.  She has run
 races of up to 3100 miles!  During her career, Suprabha has set four world
 records, including in the 1,000-mile, in the 2,700-mile, and in the 3,100-mile
 races.
 </p>
<p> Suprabha started running in 1978, at the age of twenty-two,  because of the
 encouragement of her meditation teacher, Sri Chinmoy.  The first race she ever
 ran was a four-mile race.  About two years later she ran her first marathon.  In the
 following year she tried a 47-mile race.  In 1986, she was inspired to run a 200
mile race in honor of her meditation teacher’s athletic accomplishment of lifting
two hundred pounds with one hand.
</p>
<p> Ever since then Suprabha has been practicing ultra-distance running.
 (Ultra-distance running is running over very long distances.)  In fact, she has been
 doing it for 19 years!  In addition to staying physically fit, Suprabha gets a special
 energy and joy from running. She keeps running because she loves it. She never
 intended to enter so many races or to become a champion, but that is exactly what
 happened.  In 1998, when Suprabha set the world record for the 3100-mile race, it
 took her just under 50 days.
</p>
<p>Suprabha’s running is a great example of how fitness can bring us health,
 joy and a sense of accomplishment.  Running, like other fitness activities, can
 also bring us many other benefits, such as more energy, new ideas, and a positive
 attitude.  Suprabha’s accomplishments in running can be a great inspiration to us,
 even if we don’t run.  The lesson we can learn from her running is to find a fit
ness activity that we like and stick with it. If we keep practicing it, it will help us
 in many ways.  Find your own favorite sport, and stick with it!
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview: </p>
<p>Physical fitness is an essential part of being a healthy and happy person.
 There are many kinds of fitness activities, including aerobic activities such as run
ning and brisk walking, strengthening activities such as push-ups or sit-ups, flexi
bility activities such as stretching, and coordination activities such as throwing or
 kicking a ball. </p>
<p>There is also another kind of fitness, which is “mind-body” fitness. This
 type of fitness has the goal of bringing our body and mind into harmony, so that
 we can have positive energy in our day-to-day lives. This chapter will focus on
 mind-body fitness, as it is a type of fitness that can most easily and quickly help
 us to bring harmony into our being. It is important to note that all of the kinds of
 fitness are important, as is good nutrition.  If we practice all the different kinds of
 fitness, as well as good nutrition, we can be assured of being healthy, happy and
 well-balanced in the physical, emotional and spiritual parts of ourselves. </p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 — The Five Tibetan Rites</p>
<p> Tibetan Buddhist monks say that their long lives are due to the daily per
formance of these five simple exercises, which they have practiced for hundreds
 of years.</p>
<p>a)  Gently spin yourself around clockwise.  Keep your eyes fixed on one point.
 This will focus your energy and keep you from getting dizzy.  After each revolu
tion, pause briefly. Repeat seven times.</p>
<p> b) Lie flat on your back.  Then raise your legs and head off the ground at the
 same time.  Gently lower your head and legs back down to the ground at the same
 time.  Repeat seven times.</p>
<p> c)  Sit with your knees forward and your feet behind you.  Keep your toes folded
 underneath you so they are not pointing straight back.  Begin with your head bent
 forward and downward.  Then gently bend your head backward, arching your
 back slightly.  Pause briefly, then return your head to the starting position by
 slowly bringing your head forward and lowering your head. Repeat seven times.</p>
<p> d) Sit with your legs straight out in front of you, your feet together, and your
 hands on the ground somewhat behind you.    Make a bridge by raising yourself
 upward on your hands, using your feet for balance, and arching your back.  Pause
 briefly then return to your original sitting position. Repeat seven times.
</p>
<p> e) With your face pointing downward and your hands and knees on the ground,
 straighten your legs and push your buttocks upward, making an angle with your
 body.  Pause for as long as is comfortable, then return to the starting position with
 your hands and knees on the ground.   Repeat seven times.</p>
<p> Note:  Start out by repeating the five rites seven times each.  You can try to
 increase your repetitions (as time allows) to eventually reach twenty-one 
or as many as you feel comfortable with. 
</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #2 — Hatha Yoga</p>
<p> Yoga is a Sanskrit word that means ‘union.’Yoga is a vast collection of spir
itual techniques and practices, all aimed at integrating mind, body and spirit.  Its
 goal is to achieve a state of enlightenment (wisdom) or oneness (connection) with
 the universe.  What is normally though of as ‘yoga’ in our Western part of the
 world is really Hatha Yoga, one of the many paths of yoga.  These different paths
 of yoga are simply different approaches and techniques that all lead to the same
 goal of enlightenment and oneness.
</p>
<p>Yoga is not a religion, but a spiritual practice, or sadhana, which does not
 require any specific belief system to participate.  The philosophies of yoga are
 universal and can be incorporated within any belief system.
</p>
<p>The goal of Hatha Yoga is to arrive at union of the mind, body and spirit
through a practice of yoga postures, yoga breathing, body gestures and internal
 cleansing. These body-centered practices are used to purify the body, cultivate
 prana (breath) and activate kundalini, the hidden energies of the body. Yoga,
 therefore aims at a state of union between the body and the mind, as well as
 between our individual selves and the universe.  When engaging in the practice of
 Hatha Yoga, the yogic practice of non-violence should be adhered to.</p>
<p> There are hundreds of asanas, or poses, in Hatha Yoga.  The Mountain Pose
 is one of them.
</p>
<p>The Mountain Pose:
</p>
<ul>
     <li> <p>Stand with your feet about eight to twelve inches apart.</p></li>
 <li><p>Begin with your hands folded in the center of your chest where your invisible
 heart is located.</p></li> 
 <li><p>Try to stand straight and tall with your spine in one vertical line, and your shoul
ders relaxed, arched down and back. Imagine that your feet are rooted in the
 earth, and that from the earth you are getting strength and stability.</p></li>
 <li><p>Close your eyes and breathe in.  Imagine that you are breathing in the positive
 energy of the earth. Imagine that this positive energy is flowing upward from the
 earth through your feet, up your spine and throughout your whole body.</p></li>
 <li> <p> As you breathe out, imagine that you are breathing out anything you don’t want
 in your system – restlessness, anger or any other negative emotion.  Imagine that
 these things are flowing right out into the sky and out into the universe.</p></li>
 <li><p>Repeat this type of breathing several times.  Then gather your energy where
 your hands are folded – in your invisible heart.</p></li> 
<li><p>With your eyes still closed, pay attention to how you feel right now.  Is it
 peaceful, energized, relaxed, and released? Try to name the feeling you are expe
riencing, so that you can remember it.</p></li> 
 <li><p>When you are ready, open your eyes and just rest for a few moments.</p></li>  
</ul>
<p class="side"> Lesson #3 — Tai Chi 
</p>
<p>The words “tai chi” come from the Chinese characters for Tai Chi Chuan.
 These words can be translated as the ‘Supreme Ultimate Force.’ The idea of
 ‘supreme ultimate’ is often connected with the Chinese concept of yin-yang, the
 idea that one can see a dynamic duality (male/female, active/passive, dark/light,
 forceful/yielding, etc.) in all things.  Force can be thought of here as the means or
 way of achieving this yin-yang, or supreme-ultimate discipline.</p>
<p> Tai Chi, as it is practiced in our part of the world today, can perhaps best be
 thought of as a moving form of yoga and meditation combined. There are a num-
ber of so-called forms, or sets, which consist of sequences of movements. Many
 of these movements were originally derived from the martial arts (and perhaps
 even more ancestrally than that, from the natural movements of animals and
 birds), although the way they are performed in Tai Chi is slowly, softly and grace
fully, with smooth and even transitions between them.
</p>
<p> One of the central aims of Tai Chi is to foster the circulation of the ‘chi,’ or
 vital force, within the body. According to the philosophy of Tai Chi, if ‘chi’ ener
gy is in good circulation in our body, we will have better physical health and
 vitality. This ‘chi’ circulates in patterns that are closely related to the nervous and
 vascular systems, and thus the practice of Tai Chi is closely connected with the
 practice of acupuncture and other Eastern healing arts.</p>
<p> Another aim of Tai Chi is to foster a calm and tranquil mind, focused on the
 precise execution of the exercises. Learning to do them correctly provides a prac
tical avenue for learning about such things as balance, alignment, fine-scale motor
 control, and the rhythm of movement. Thus the practice of Tai Chi can in some
 measure contribute to being able to stand, walk, move and run better in other
 spheres of life as well. Many practitioners notice benefits in the correction of poor
 postural, alignment or movement patterns which can contribute to tension or
 injury. Furthermore, the meditative nature of the exercises is calming and relaxing
 in and of itself.
</p>
<p>Tai Chi Walking:</p>
<ul>
    <li> <p>Begin with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands behind your back, and
 now lower your body by bending your knees.</p></li>
 <li><p>Raise your right leg slowly and take a step forward, bringing down your foot,
 heel and then toe. </p></li>
 <li> <p>Shift your weight forward onto your bent right leg.</p></li>
 <li><p> Now move left foot out. Slowly raise left leg and take a step forward, staying in
 crouched position, heel and then toe. </p> </li>
 <li> <p>Imagine a direction you want to go in, in your life, or a problem that you need
 to solve.  As you practice the walking, you are beginning that 1,000-mile journey.
 It begins with one step. </p></li>
 <li><p>Take that step, and practice breathing out as you come down with your foot and
 breathing in as you come up with your foot, slowly. The more slowly one goes,
 the more chi is generated. It takes greater control to go slow, rather than fast.</p></li>
 <li> <p>Repeat the steps above as you visualize yourself moving confidently and pow
erfully towards your goal.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="side">Lesson #4 – ‘Brain Gym’Exercises</p>
<p>These simple exercises are based on the work presented by Carla Hannaford,
 Ph.D.  Dr. Hannaford is a neurophysiologist and educator with more than 28 years
 of teaching experience. In her best-selling book, Smart Moves, Dr. Hannaford
 states that our bodies are very much a part of all of our learning — that learning
 is not an isolated ‘brain’ function. Every nerve and cell is a network contributing
 to our intelligence and our learning capability.  ‘Brain Gym’ exercises can help
 improve your concentration in class.  Here are four basic ‘Brain Gym’ exercises
 which implement the ideas developed by Carla Hannover.  They can be used
 quickly in any classroom. They are surprisingly simple, but very effective!</p>
<p> Drink Water:</p>
<p>As Carla Hannaford says, “Water comprises more of the brain than of any
 other organ of the body.” Having students drink some water before and during
 class can help ‘grease the wheel.’ Drinking water is very important before any
 stressful situation – for example, tests! - as we tend to perspire under stress, and
 de-hydration can have a bad effect on our concentration.</p>
<p> Brain Buttons: </p>
<p>This exercise helps improve blood flow to the brain, in order to “switch
 on” the entire brain before a lesson begins. The increased blood flow helps
 improve concentration skills required for reading, writing, etc.</p>
 <ul>
    <li><p>Position one hand so that there is as wide a space as possible between the
 thumb and index finger.</p></li>
    <li><p>Place your index finger and thumb into the slight indentations below the collar
 bone on each side of the sternum. Press lightly in a pulsing manner.</p></li>
    <li> <p>At the same time put the other hand over the navel area of the stomach. Gently
 press on these points for about 2 minutes</p></li>
 </ul>
<p> Cross Crawl:</p>
<p>This exercise helps coordinate the right and left brains by increasing the
 information flow between the two hemispheres. It is useful for spelling, writing,
 listening, reading and comprehension.</p>
 <ul>
    <li> <p>Stand or sit. Put the right hand across the body to the left knee as you raise it,
 and then do the same thing with the left hand on the right knee, just as if you
 were marching.</p></li>
 <li> <p>Continue doing this for about 2 minutes.</p></li>
 </ul>
<p>Hook-Ups:</p>
<p> This works well for nerves before a test or special event such as making a
 speech. Any situation which could cause nervousness calls for a few “hook-ups”
 to calm the mind and improve concentration.</p>
 <ul>
    <li><p>Stand or sit. Cross the right leg over the left at the ankles.</p></li>
    <li><p>Take your right wrist and cross it over the left wrist and link up the fingers so
 that the right wrist is on top.</p></li>
 <li><p>Bend the elbows out and gently turn the fingers in towards the body until they
 rest on the sternum (breast bone) in the center of the chest. Stay in this position.</p></li>
 <li><p>Keep the ankles crossed and the wrists crossed and then breathe evenly in this
 position for a few minutes. You will be noticeably calmer after that time.</p></li>
 </ul>
<p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
<p> a) How do you feel after doing some of the exercises in this chapter? Do you feel
 any changes? Do you feel better?  What is your favorite lesson or exercise?</p>
<p>b) Congratulations! Now you are on the road to becoming an expert on your own
 body. Why do you think it is important to be in tune with your body?</p>
<p> c) Can you think of reasons why doing these kinds of exercises with your body
 might help your mind?  You can make a list of your answers.</p>
<p> d) Can you think of reasons why doing these kinds of exercises with your body
 might help your invisible heart or your spirit?  How might they make you feel
 inside if you practice some of them regularly?  You can make a list of these
 answers, too, if you wish.</p>
<p class="side">Supplemental Activities:</p>
<ul>
    <li><p>Aerobics: Aerobic activities such as running, walking, or playing sports are
 extremely important for overall fitness. They help keep our heart and lungs
 strong, improve our circulation, and cleanse our blood.  Which aerobics activities
 do you practice? Try to practice some aerobic activity each day or at least three
 times per week.</p></li>
 <li><p>Coordination:  Coordination activities such as ball games, dancing, and other
creative movement activities are important for connecting our senses with our
 bodies. These kinds of activities are also very good for activating the different
 parts of our brain, and they can help us to concentrate and do our academic work.
 Practice coordination by choosing a partner and throwing a small, softball back
 and forth.  After you are good at catching with two hands try catching with one!</p></li>
 <li> <p>Strength: Strengthening activities such as push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, or work
ing with weights, help us to maintain healthy muscles. If our muscles are not used
 they can become weak.   Strong muscles not only improve our blood flow and
 keep our back and joints healthy, they are very useful too!  Practice a few
 strengthening activities such as push-ups or sit-ups.</p></li>
 <li> <p>Nutrition: Good nutrition is essential to being physically fit.  It is also crucial to
 maintaining emotional balance and mental sharpness. Let’s ask everyone in the
 class to try to go one week without eating any kind of sugar. During this time, try
 to eat more fruits and vegetables and drink lots of water.  After one week, how
 many students in the class were able to do it?  Discuss how those who did it feel.
 Also discuss any changes you noticed in your routine, in your sleep patterns, and
 in your ability to do your schoolwork.</p></li>
 <li> <p>Mind-body fitness includes the martial arts.  How many people in the class
 practice a martial art?  Make a list of the different martial arts that people practice
 or that you know of.</p></li>
 <li> <p>Many of the mind-body lessons we have studied come from places in Asia.
 Look on a map and try to locate India (the birthplace of yoga), China (the birth
place of Tai Chi) and Tibet (the birthplace of the Tibetan rites). </p></li>
