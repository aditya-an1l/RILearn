<p class="side">Chapter Story:
</p>
<p> Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in Italy.  She grew up as a very intelli
gent young girl who had a compassionate heart and a very determined mind.
 Maria’s parents said that growing up she was "talented but headstrong." She often
 interrupted her parents during discussions they had in order to offer her opinions,
 even if her parents were talking about adult topics.  In games with other children
 Maria was often the leader.  At school, Maria learned very easily and did excep
tionally well on her exams.  In those days, most elementary schools were very
 dirty and crowded. This is something that Maria noticed and remembered later on
 in life when she founded her own school.
</p>
<p> She enjoyed talking to her neighbor, a little girl who had been born as a
 hunchback.  The girl didn’t have many friends and so she valued her friendship
 with Maria. Maria liked to take the little girl out for walks.
</p>
<p> Maria’s father and mother were both very important in her life.  It was
 Maria’s mother who encouraged Maria to keep on studying hard and to follow her
 dreams and ambitions. Maria’s mother believed her daughter would one day
 accomplish something great -- and she was right. Maria did very well in all of her
 high school subjects and she passed her high school final exams with very high
 grades. In college she studied modern language and natural sciences.  Of all of
 her classes, math was her favorite subject. She did very well in college also and
 graduated with honors.  </p>
<p>Maria decided she wanted to continue studying so she could become a doc
tor. However, at that time, no woman had ever been allowed to go to medical
 school in Italy. In the 1890’s in Italy, a woman could not walk in the street alone,
 could not write her own check, and basically could not do anything without her
 husband.  Maria did not believe these customs were right and when the University
 of Rome told her she could not go to the medical school, she became even more
 determined to reach her dream.</p>
<p> Maria enrolled as a student in physics, mathematics and natural sciences.
 Her plan was to keep on studying until she could convince the university to
 accept her as a medical student.  During this time Maria’s father was very
 opposed to the idea of his daughter becoming a doctor. According to his beliefs,
 this was just wrong; but Maria’s mother continued to support her. While other stu
dents would be having fun with their friends in the evenings, Maria just kept on
 studying. She passed a special exam that showed she was qualified to become a
medical student.  She never stopped asking the University to allow her to join the
 medical school, and finally the University gave up trying to say no. They decided
 to accept her into medical school.
</p>
<p>In medical school it was not easy to be the only woman. Maria did not
 have any female students she could be friends with and the men often made fun
 of her. Because she was so smart and so determined, the male medical students
 eventually accepted her, treated her more nicely and became her friends. Mean
while, Maria’s father did not speak to her very much because he was still upset
 with her decision to study medicine. Maria’s mother continued to support her and
 even helped her to study sometimes. In 1896 Maria presented her medical thesis
 to a board of ten men.  They were very impressed and granted her the doctor of
 medicine degree.  Maria Montessori had become the first woman to graduate
 from medical school in Italy!  But that was just the beginning of her accomplish
ments.
 
</p>
<p> Maria began her career as a doctor working in a hospital for the mentally
 ill. There she became interested in mentally and emotionally challenged children.
 In 1898 she was appointed director of the Orthophrenic School in Rome.  There
 she pioneered in the instruction of retarded children, especially through the use of
 an environment rich in manipulative materials.  She saw how the retarded chil
dren made incredible progress in learning when they were in an inspiring learning
 environment, and surrounded by loving care and encouragement.  Maria believed
 that if she provided the same kind of teaching atmosphere for children who were
 not retarded that they, too, would show remarkable progress. In 1907 Maria
 opened the first Casa dei Bambini (Children’s House) as a day care center in the
 San Lorenzo district of Rome.  In this first school, Maria worked with some of
 the poorest children in Rome.  In those days, many people believed that poor chil
dren could not learn well or behave well.  Maria proved this was wrong, because
 her preschool children made tremendous progress in their learning.
</p>
<p> Maria’s success with the underprivileged children in San Lorenzo made
 her famous.  Maria began to teach others about how to make this kind of school.
 Her method was called the Montessori Method and the schools that she and her
 followers founded were called Montessori schools.  They were started all over
 Europe and in the United States.  The first Montessori school in the U.S. was
 started in 1912, near Tarrytown, New York.  </p>
<p>Eventually, there were Montessori schools around the whole world.
 Maria’s schools had a very special philosophy.  She always remembered how
 dirty and crowded her own elementary school was when she was growing up.
 Maria was determined that her own schools would be beautiful, clean, and well
 organized.  During Maria’s time there was a general belief that children naturally
 wanted to behave badly.  Most people believed that children needed to be taught
 to fear teachers and parents, and that they needed to be punished when they did
things wrong.  It was also believed that children were lazy and had to be forced to
 study and learn.  Maria believed this attitude was wrong and incorrect.  In Maria’s
 schools, children were treated with love and respect.  Children were allowed to
 follow their own interests and to learn how to be a part of a community. The chil
dren made great progress because they were having fun. They behaved well
 because they learned to respect each other.
</p>
<p> Maria believed that if children were allowed to learn in an accepting
 atmosphere, they would grow into adults who would be able to make a more
 peaceful and just planet.  Maria did not believe it was right that so many people
 in the world lived in poverty. During her time in San Lorenzo, and later during
 her travels in India, Maria saw many very poor people and many children who
 could not go to school.  She wanted her educational system to inspire people
 across the world to help these children and give them an opportunity to go to
 school and blossom. 
</p>
<p>Maria thought that everyone in the world deserves to have healthy food to
 eat, a safe home to live in, good medicine, and a school that has a peaceful envi
ronment.  In her speeches around the world, Maria spoke out against the unfair
ness of the world situation, where some people have so much and others have to
 survive on so little.  Maria believed that the students at her schools around the
 world would grow up and make the world a different and better place for all.
</p>
<p> Maria thought that war was a failure of humanity to find peaceful solu
tions.  During World War II, Maria spoke out against her own government in Italy
 because she did not believe her government was truly trying to make peace and
 justice for all. The Italian government did not like this, and, in order to avoid
 being arrested, Maria had to live in other countries for the final years of her life.
 Throughout her life Maria worked for the rights of women and children around
 the world.  She was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize several times, though
 she never received it.  Some of her followers believe she deserves to receive it
 still, even though she is no longer alive. Maria Montessori’s whole life was dedi
cated to the idea that all people on the planet need to learn to peacefully share the
 earth’s resources.  Today, students, parents, and teachers at Montessori schools
 around the world still work for this goal.  Maria was a leader in showing that
 women can succeed in medical school, a leader in speaking out for the rights of
 women and children, and a leader in showing teachers that children can be taught
 most effectively when they are treated with love and respect.</p>
<p>Chapter Overview: </p>
<p>Leadership is something difficult to define. What makes a good leader?  A
 good leader is somebody who is strong but not too bossy; someone who is coura
geous but not foolhardy; someone who is compassionate but who gets his follow
ers to transcend themselves; someone who is wise but is not a know- it-all; some
one who has a vision but doesn’t impose it on others; someone who knows the
 right things to say but also the right time to say them.  </p>
<p>Some of the greatest definitions of leadership have come from an ancient
 Chinese philosopher called Lao Tzu, who was the founder of the philosophy of
 Taoism.  Here are some of Lao Tzu’s statements about what it means to be a good
 leader:</p>
<p> Agood leader is constantly without a mind of his own. He takes as his
 own the mind of the people.</p>
<p> People often prefer a mountainous way. The leader tries to find the
 smoothest way</p>
<p>The leader does not take too many actions to get the people to follow.  By
 remaining positive and trusting in them, the people are transformed of them
selves.</p>
<p> Aleader is sparing in his accumulation of material things, but he accumu
lates an abundance of spiritual virtues.</p>
<p> Aleader tries to be good and does not worry about becoming great.</p>
<p> Aleader focuses on the little things because they are the most important.
 He lets the big things come on their own.
</p>
<p> Aleader doesn’t make promises rashly because such promises he may not
 be able to keep. A leader doesn’t make decisions too quickly because those might
 not be the best decisions.  A leader considers things thoroughly before making a
 promise or a decision.</p>
<p> Aleader sees and addresses possible problems before they get to be too
 big. When they are still small or still out on the horizon, they can be solved much
 more easily than if they are allowed to get big.
</p>
<p> Aleader has the vision to keep focused on the goal when others lose
 track of it.</p>
<p> Aleader is humble and doesn’t brag or become a bother to others.  There
fore, people follow a leader joyfully because they just want to.
</p>
<p>Aleader gives of himself – both in terms of his wisdom and in terms of his
 willingness to help others. He doesn’t hold back when it comes to supporting others.
</p>
<p> Aleader is compassionate to all.  The followers feel that the leader cares
 for everyone equally.</p>
<p> Aleader is quick to forgive others an injury.  He knows it is one of the best
 ways to build friendship and loyalty.
</p>
<p> Aleader does not get angry very easily and does not engage in too many
 arguments. The best way to stay strong is to be in control of one’s emotions and
 to not be too insistent on one point of view.
</p>
<p> These are some of the lessons of leadership from Lao Tzu.  There have
 been many leaders in human history. Some of them have been good leaders who
 have worked for peace and partnership. Some have been bad leaders who started
 wars or took high taxes from their people.  To learn be a good leader, it is helpful
 to practice some of the guidelines of Lao Tzu. We can all become positive leaders
 if we want to.  Each of us has that capacity, that potential inside us. In fact, if we
 all become positive leaders – each in our own way – then we can all help the
 world move forward towards harmony and partnership.  There have been many
 brave men and women in the past who decided to become positive leaders in their
 lives.  You can become one too!
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1- Aphorisms on leadership  
</p>
<p>In this lesson we will read some aphorisms about leadership. We will dis
cuss the meaning and the main point of each one briefly. Then we will each pick
 one that we like and write it into our journal. After you copy one of the aphorisms
 into your journal, then either write a paragraph about the meaning of the aphorism
 or draw a picture that illustrates the aphorism.  You can do both a paragraph and a
 picture if you wish. Note that girls and boys both can be leaders so it doesn’t mat
ter if we use the word ‘she’ or ‘he’ in the aphorisms. </p>
<p>a)</p>
<p>A leader is she who looks to see</p>
<p>What might possibly be coming to be,</p>
<p>Or how she can help others in need</p>
<p>And keep everyone conflict-free.</p>

<p>b)</p>
<p>A leader has patience and always can wait</p>
<p>To see the truth, even if it comes late.</p>
<p>She strives to be good instead of just great,</p>
<p>But when it’s time to act, she won’t hesitate.</p>

<p>c)</p>
<p>A leader listens with heart and with mind,</p>
<p>To hear clearly what might be the bind,</p>
<p>So she can more wisely and aptly find</p>
<p>The way to be helpful and to be kind.</p>

<p>d)</p>
<p>A leader has courage to do or to say</p>
<p>What’s righteous and good every day.</p>
<p>Whether it’s at work or it’s at play,</p>
<p>She’s for the just and the fair kind of way.</p>

<p>e)</p>
<p>A leader can appreciate the important thing,</p>
<p>Not the radio or the telephone’s ring,</p>
<p>But the song that the spring bird might sing,</p>
<p>Or the good news the shining sun can bring.</p>

<p>f)</p>
<p>A leader meditates at those special times,</p>
<p>When she needs to feel the inner rhymes</p>
<p>And the sweet ringing of her spirit-chimes</p>
<p>To help get her through the stormy climes.</p>

<p>g)</p>
<p>A leader strives for a wisdom that’s deep,</p>
<p>A message that everyone might want to keep,</p>
<p>To help them climb a mountain steep,</p>
<p>Or to make them smile instead of weep.</p>

<p>h)</p>
<p>A leader can focus on what she must do</p>
<p>To help pull her team all the way through.</p>
<p>She shows everyone how they can choose</p>
<p>A game where nobody needs ever to lose.</p>

<p>i)</p>
<p>A leader likes to use humor in doses</p>
<p>So others won’t just turn up their noses.</p>
<p>At times she might like to give out some roses</p>
<p>Flowers spread love, is what she supposes.</p>

<p class="side"> Lesson #2 - Creating and performing a skit on the life of Maria Montessor
</p>
<p> For this lesson we will break into groups of two to five people.  Each
 group will create a short skit about an incident or a part of Maria Montessori’s
 life.  First, your group will need to write a short script. Then you will need to
 make or find some simple props and costumes. Finally, you will need to practice
 your skits before it is time to perform them for the class.  Here are a few ideas for
 your skits:</p>
 <p>a) In this skit, show a conversation between Maria, her father and her mother, when Maria announces that she wants to become a doctor. Maria’s father was very upset by this and did not agree with her decision. Her mother was much more understanding and supportive. How do you think the conversation went? How did it end?</p>

<p>b) A skit showing what happened when Maria met with the administrators at the University of Rome. (The administrators can be the president of the university, the vice-president, the dean, or one of the other people who help to run the university). During this skit, Maria tries to convince them that she should be allowed to go to medical school even though she is a woman. The administrators do not want to allow it, even though she shows them her medical entrance exam scores, which are outstanding. She pleads with them that it is not fair for her not to be allowed to go. At the end, they decide to consider it. Or, you can make Maria’s meeting with the administrators be Scene One, and then you can show the administrators discussing the situation at a private meeting in Scene Two. Then, in Scene Three, you can show the administrators announcing to Maria that they have finally decided to accept her.</p>

<p>c) This skit will show Italian government officials telling Maria she must live in another country because of her peace protests against the Italian government. During this meeting, Maria tells them that she has a right to say what she believes and she has a right to stay in her own country – the country she was born in. She tells the government officials that their attitudes and policies are not peaceful ones because they focus on dividing people and not on unifying them. She tells them that it is not just or fair to separate the Jewish people from the rest of society and to give them fewer rights than other kinds of people. She also tells them that to support Adolf Hitler is wrong because he is killing millions of Jews and others whom he considers inferior. The government officials listen to Maria but do not agree with her. They tell her that if she does not stop her protests or leave the country she will be put in jail. Maria tells them again that she will not stop speaking out for peace and justice and that she will move to another country – a more peaceful country – if she has to.</p>

<p>d) This skit will show Maria’s first conversations or meetings with the other medical students at the University of Rome, who are all men. The male medical students make fun of Maria because she is a woman and because they have stereotyped attitudes toward women. They are not used to a woman who wants to be independent, and who believes that women deserve the same rights as men. This skit can have two or three scenes. By the end of the skit, the men begin to accept Maria because they can see how determined she is to be a doctor and how much she wants to help the world. They also begin to see how smart and funny she can be, and so they accept her as a friend and as a colleague. They apologize for their bad treatment of her.</p>

<p>e) This skit will show a fictional (a make believe) debate between Maria and some other educators. The other educators believe in the old way of educating. They believe that children are lazy and don’t like to do school work. They also believe that children behave badly and that they need to be punished, that they need to learn to be afraid of teachers and parents. Maria tells them that this attitude is wrong and incorrect. She tells them that children can behave very well naturally, on their own, if they are doing activities that are interesting and fun for them. You can decide how you want this skit to end. Perhaps it can end with the educators telling Maria that they don’t believe in her kind of education and that she will have

 <p class="side"> Lesson #3 - Leadership qualities</p>
 <p> Using the guidelines of Lao Tzu presented in the Chapter Overview, and
 the aphorisms in Lesson #1, let’s make a list of some of the most important quali
ties of leadership. We will write them first on the blackboard, and then everyone
 will write them into their journals. Each day we can be on the look-out for when
 our classmates, our teachers, our family members or others show these qualities
 through their different actions.  We will set a time each day, or at least once each
 week, when we can share the leadership qualities we have observed and when we
 can acknowledge each other for practicing them.</p>
 <p class="side">Lesson #4 - Guidance about leadership from the literature of indigenous peoples</p>
 <p> The indigenous people of the earth are those people who have lived in one
 place for a very long time and who practice traditional ways of living.  These are
 people such as the Native American tribes of North America, the Aborigines in
 Australia, the Maori in New Zealand, and many others. These people have
 learned how to live in harmony with the earth and to survive in harsh natural con
ditions.  For them, having a strong leader has always been very important. They
 have passed down many stories about leadership from generation to generation.
 For the indigenous peoples, leadership often has to do with stewardship of the
 earth and protecting the future generations who will live on it.</p>
 <p> Choose from one of the passages of leadership wisdom of indigenous
 people, presented below.  Then write it into your journal in your best handwriting.
 Draw a picture or do a piece of writing to go with the quotation. Note: After each
 passage there is a brief note which explains the main image of the passage.</p>
 <p>a) “Treat the earth well: it was not given to you by your parents, it was loaned to you by your children. We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children. We are more than the sum or our knowledge, we are products of our imagination.” –Ancient proverb</p>

<p>b) “Peace and happiness are available at every moment. Peace is in every step. We shall walk hand-in-hand. There are no political solutions to spiritual problems. Remember: If the Creator put it there, it is in the right place. The soul would have no rainbow if the eyes had no tears.” –An Indian Chief, 1876</p>

<p>c) “I was not raised to look at people racially. What I was taught is that we’re flowers in the Great Spirit’s garden. We share a common root, and the root is Mother Earth.” –Oh Shinnah</p>

<p>d) “We must protect the forests for our children, grandchildren, and children yet to be born. We must protect the forests for those who can’t speak for themselves, such as the birds, animals, fish, and trees.” –Qwatsinas Edward Moody, Nuxalk Nation</p>

<p>e) "We learned to be patient observers, like the owl. We learned cleverness from the crow, and courage from the jay, who will attack an owl ten times its size to drive it off its territory. But above all of them ranked the chickadee because of its indomitable spirit." –Tom Brown, Jr., The Tracker</p>

<p>f) "When we Indians kill meat, we eat it all up. When we dig roots, we make little holes. When we build houses, we make little holes. When we burn grass for grasshoppers, we don't ruin things. We shake down acorns and pine nuts -- we don't chop down the trees. We only use dead wood. But the white people plow up the ground, pull down the trees, kill everything. ... the white people pay no attention. ...How can the spirit of the earth like the white man? ... everywhere the white man has touched it, it is sore." –Wintu Woman, 19th Century</p>

<p>g) "The Circle will not be mended as long as the People war among themselves. It will not be mended as long as we try to mend the Sacred Circle with broken Circles. We all need to pray on this..." –Gary Armstrong</p>

<p>h) "Once I was in Victoria, and I saw a very large house. They told me it was a bank and that the white men place their money there to be taken care of, and that by and by they get it back with interest. We are Indians and we have no such bank; but when we have plenty of money or blankets, we give them away to other chiefs and people, and by and by they return them with interest, and our hearts feel good. Our way of giving is our bank." –Chief Maquinna, Nootka</p>

<p>i) "Nuclear waste is a heavy burden to lay on our children and their children and their children's children and their children's children's children and their children's children's children's children..." –Rufina M. Laws</p>

<p>j) "In an eagle there is all the wisdom of the world." –Lame Deer, Minnicoujou</p>

<p>k) "There are many things to be shared with the Four Colors of humanity, in our common destiny, at one with our Mother the Earth. It is this sharing that must be considered with great care by the Elders and the medicine people who carry the Sacred Trusts, so that no harm may come to people through ignorance and misuse of these powerful forces." –Resolution of the Fifth Annual Meetings of the Traditional Elders Circle, 1980</p>

<p>l) I know that all must be brought into the Sacred Hoop for it to be mended. I often wonder how we will bring those who do not see even the simplest of Circles into the greatest Circle of all. Then I remember it is a thing that has been promised by Spirit. That is how I know it will come to be. –Gary Night Owl</p>

 <p class="side"> Lesson #5 - Leadership cards</p>
 <p>In this lesson, we will each create leadership cards for ourselves.
 First, you will choose ten special qualities that you have or that you would like to
 remember.  Or you can choose leadership actions you want to try to practice.
Then you will write these qualities or actions neatly on 3 x 5 cards. We can deco
rate each card a bit in order to make it special.  Then each day we will take a few
 minutes when everyone can pick out one of their cards to look at and to reflect
 upon.  Each day, when you pick out one card, ask yourself whether you have been
 practicing that quality or action or not. If you have been practicing it, ask yourself
 how you can do an even better job of practicing it.  Here are some examples of
 what you write on your cards:</p>
 <h2><p>Qualities</h2></p>

<p>patience</p>
<p>caring</p>
<p>sharing</p>
<p>forgiveness</p>
<p>creativity</p>
<p>courtesy</p>
<p>honesty</p>
<p>courage</p>
<p>imagination</p>
<p>self-reflection</p>
<p>non-violence</p>
<p>compassion</p>
<h2><p> Actions:</p></h2>
<p>helping others</p>
<p>respecting people’s property</p>
<p>keeping room/desk tidy</p>
<p>being a problem solver</p>
<p>practicing conflict resolution</p>
<p>being polite towards others</p>
<p>expressing your feelings</p>
<p>speaking your truth</p>
<p>using your ‘mind’s eye’</p>
<p>visiting your ‘invisible heart’</p>
<p>not harming living things</p>
<p>using your words for good</p>

 <p class="side"> Lesson #6 - Leadership Pledge</p>
 <p> We will recite the leadership pledge below and discuss the meaning of the
 different parts of it. We will explain any words that might be difficult to under
stand. A pledge is like a promise or a commitment that you make to yourself and
 to others.  If you wish, and whenever you are ready, you can sign the Leadership
 Pledge and paste it into your journal or keep it in some other special place.</p>
 <p> Leadership Pledge</p>
 <p> I will practice nonviolence on a daily basis, in words and in deeds.  This
 means I will strive not to intentionally hurt others through what I say or what I
 do. This also means I will try to avoid violent games and entertainment.</p>
 <p> I will strive to learn and practice patience, tolerance, respect and accept
ance of others.  I will try to see things from other people’s points of view, and to
 honor their work, feelings, and ideas.</p>
 <p> I will strive to practice openness and flexibility so that I can learn from
 new situations and appreciate different ways of doing things.</p>
 <p></p>
 <p>I will strive to practice cooperation and conflict resolution so I can learn
to work with others productively and to solve problems peacefully.</p>

<p>I will strive to keep on learning about the world and all the living things in
it, so I can keep expanding my mental horizons and become a knowledgeable
global citizen.</p>

<p>I will strive to practice caring and compassion so I can enhance my heart’s
capacity for giving to others and for feeling oneness with others.</p>

<p>I will strive to practice honesty and courage so I can express my feelings
and needs honestly, and so that I can speak my truth about what I believe.</p>

<p>I commit to taking some time each day to reflect in silence upon my
progress as a leader, as well as upon my own personal thoughts, feelings, and
dreams.</p>

<p>I will work towards being a good citizen of my community. This means I
will do my chores and keep up with my other responsibilities at home and at
school. It means I will listen to my parents and my teachers, as well as respectfully speak my truth to my parents and teachers. It means I will try to be a supportive classmate and friend, as well as a good ‘buddy’ to the younger students. It
also means I will do some form of regular community service for my school, my
town/city, or the world.</p>

<p>I will aim to be an excellent student at school and in life. This does not
mean that I have to always get the highest grades. It means I will always give my
best effort. It means I will try to learn from every subject and from all kinds of
situations.</p>

<p>I will practice self-transcendence – not competition with others. This
means that what is most important is my own self-improvement and not whether I
am better than someone else.</p>

<p>I will try my utmost to live each day according to the ideals of this pledge.</p>
<p class="side"> Discussion Questions:</p>
<p>a) What do you think Harry Truman meant when he said, “Men make history and not the other way around”? Note: When he said “men” he meant people.</p>

<p>b) Captain J.A. Hadfield says that the art of resting the mind is the secret to being a good leader and to having positive energy. Study his quotation above. Given what you have learned in this book, why do you think it is important to rest your mind and reflect on a regular basis?</p>

<p>c) “The world belongs to the energetic,” said Ralph Waldo Emerson. Why do you think energy is so important to being a leader? What kind of energy does a leader have?</p>

<p>d) Anthony Burgess said, “Laugh and the world laughs with you, snore and you sleep alone.” Discuss the possible meaning or meanings of this quotation.</p>
<p class="side">Supplemental Activities</p>
<p>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <p>Think of someone you know who is a leader. It could be someone in your family, in your neighborhood, at your church, on your sports team, or at school. Think about this person and about what makes them a leader. Take a few minutes to write down what it is that makes that person special. Share with the class about this special person. The next time you see this person, why not tell them what you think of them!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write down the leadership guidelines from Lao Tzu in your journal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you have time, copy into your journal all of the leadership aphorisms in this chapter. Or, if you prefer, you can copy the leadership qualities from the quotations from indigenous peoples and do a drawing or paragraph for each one.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
