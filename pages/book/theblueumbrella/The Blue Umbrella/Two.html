    </h1>
    <p>BINYA seldom closed the blue umbrella. Even when she had it in the
house, she left it lying open in a corner of the room. Sometimes Bijju
snapped it shut, complaining that it got in the way. She would open it
again a little later. It wasn’t beautiful when it was closed.
</p>
<p>Whenever Binya went out—whether it was to graze the cows, or fetch
water from the spring, or carry milk to the little tea shop on the Tehri road
—she took the umbrella with her. That patch of skyblue silk could always
be seen on the hillside.
</p>
<p>Old Ram Bharosa (Ram the Trustworthy) kept the tea shop on the Tehri
road. It was a dusty, unmetalled road. Once a day, the Tehri bus stopped
near his shop and passengers got down to sip hot tea or drink a glass of
curds. He kept a few bottles of Coca-cola too; but as there was no ice, the
bottles got hot in the sun and so were seldom opened. He also kept sweets
and toffees, and when Binya or Bijju had a few coins to spare they would
spend them at the shop. It was only a mile from the village.
</p>
<p>
  Ram Bharosa was astonished to see Binya’s blue umbrella.
</p>
<p>“What have you there, Binya?” he asked.
</p>
<p>Binya gave the umbrella a twirl and smiled at Ram Bharosa. She was
always ready with her smile, and would willingly have lent it to anyone
who was feeling unhappy.
</p>
<p>“That’s a lady’s umbrella,” said Ram Bharosa. “That’s only for MemSahibs. Where did you get it?”
</p>
<p>“Someone gave it to me—for my necklace.”</p>
<p>“You exchanged it for your lucky claw!”
</p>
<p>Binya nodded.</p>
<p>“But what do you need it for? The sun isn’t hot enough—and it isn’t
meant for the rain. It’s just a pretty thing for rich ladies to play with!”
</p>
<p>Binya nodded and smiled again. Ram Bharosa was quite right; it was
just a beautiful plaything. And that was exactly why she had fallen in love
with it.</p>
<p>“I have an idea,” said the shopkeeper. “It’s no use to you, that umbrella.
Why not sell it to me? I’ll give you five rupees for it.”
</p>
<p>“It’s worth fifteen,” said Binya.
</p>
<p>“Well, then, I’ll give you ten.”
</p>
<p>Binya laughed and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Twelve rupees?” said Ram Bharosa, but without much hope.
</p>
<p>Binya placed a five-paise coin on the counter. “I came for a toffee,” she
said.
</p>
<p>Ram Bharosa pulled at his drooping whiskers, gave Binya a wry look,
and placed a toffee in the palm of her hand. He watched Binya as she
walked away along the dusty road. The blue umbrella held him fascinated,
and he stared after it until it was out of sight.
</p>
<p>The villagers used this road to go to the market-town. Some used the
bus; a few rode on mules; most people walked. Today, everyone on the road
turned their heads to stare at the girl with the bright blue umbrella.
</p>
<p>Binya sat down in the shade of a pine tree. The umbrella, still open, lay
beside her. She cradled her head in her arms, and presently she dozed off. It
was that kind of day, sleepily warm and summery.
</p>
<p>And while she slept, a wind sprang up.</p>
<p>It came quietly, swishing gently through the trees, humming softly.
Then it was joined by other random gusts, bustling over the tops of the
mountains. The trees shook their heads and came to life. The wind fanned
Binya’s cheeky. The umbrella stirred on the grass.</p>
<p>The wind grew stronger, picking up dead leaves and sending them
spinning and swirling through the air. It got into the umbrella and began to
drag it over the grass. Suddenly it lifted the umbrella and carried it about six
feet from the sleeping girl. The sound woke Binya.
</p>
<p>She was on her feet immediately, and then she was leaping down the
steep slope. But just as she was within reach of the umbrella, the wind
picked it up again and carried it further downhill.</p>
<p>Binya set off in pursuit. The wind was in a wicked, playful mood. It
would leave the umbrella alone for a few moments; but, as soon as Binya
came near, it would pick up the umbrella again and send it bouncing,
floating, dancing away from her.
</p>
<p>The hill grew steeper. Binya knew that after twenty yards it would fall
away in a precipice. She ran faster. And the wind ran with her, ahead of her,
and the blue umbrella stayed up with the wind.</p>
<p>
  A fresh gust picked it up and carried it to the very edge of the cliff.
There it balanced for a few seconds, before toppling over, out of sight.
</p>
<p>
  Binya ran to the edge of the cliff. Going down on her hands and knees,
she peered down the cliff-face. About a hundred feet below, a small stream
rushed between great boulders. Hardly anything grew on the cliff-face—just
a few stunted bushes, and, halfway down, a wild cherry tree growing
crookedly out of the rocks and hanging across the chasm. The umbrella had
stuck in the cherry tree.

</p>
<p>Binya didn’t hesitate. She may have been timid with strangers, but she
was at home on a hillside. She stuck her bare leg over the edge of the cliff
and began climbing down. she kept her face to the hillside, feeling her way
with her feet, only changing her handhold when she knew her feet were
secure. Sometimes she held on to the thorny bilberry bushes, but she did not
trust the other plants, which came away very easily.
</p>
<p>Loose stones rattled down the cliff. Once on their way, the stones did
not stop until they reached the bottom of the hill; and they took other stones
with them, so that there was soon a cascade of stones, and Binya had to be
very careful not to start a landslide.</p>
<p>As agile as a mountain-goat, she did not take more than five minutes to
reach the crooked cherry tree. But the most difficult task remained. She had
to crawl along the trunk of the tree, which stood out at right angles from the
cliff. Only by doing this could she reach the trapped umbrella.
</p>
<p>Binya felt no fear when climbing trees. She was proud of the fact that
she could climb them as well as Bijju. Gripping the rough cherry bark with
her toes, and using her knees as leverage, she crawled along the trunk of the
projecting tree until she was almost within reach of the umbrella. She
noticed with dismay that the blue cloth was torn in a couple of places.</p>
<p>She looked down; and it was only then that she felt afraid. She was right
over the chasm, balanced precariously about eighty feet above the boulderstrewn stream. Looking down, she felt quite dizzy. Her hands shook, and
the tree shook too. If she slipped now, there was only one direction in which
she could fall—down, down, into the depths of that dark and shadowy
ravine</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do; concentrate on the patch of blue just a
couple of feet away from her.</p>
<p>She did not look down or up, but straight ahead; and willing herself
forward, she managed to reach the umbrella.</p>
<p>She could not crawl back with it in her hands. So, after dislodging it
from the forked branch in which it had stuck, she let it fall, still open, into
the ravine below. Cushioned by the wind, the umbrella floated serenely
downwards, landing in a thicket of nettles.
</p>
<p>Binya crawled back along the trunk of the cherry tree.
</p>
<p>Twenty minutes later she emerged from the nettle clump, her precious
umbrella held aloft. She had nettle stings all over her legs, but she was
hardly aware of the smarting. She was as immune to nettles as Bijju was to
bees.</p>
