      <p>The Tunnel</p>
    </h1>
    <p>It was almost noon, and the jungle was very still, very silent. Heat waves shimmered
along the railway embankment where it cut a path through the tall evergreen trees. The
railway lines were two straight black serpents disappearing into the tunnel in the
hillside.</p>
<p>Suraj stood near the cutting, waiting for the mid-day train. It wasn’t a station, and he
wasn’t catching a train. He was waiting so that he could watch the steam-engine come
roaring out of the tunnel.
</p>
<p>He had cycled out of the town and taken the jungle path until he had come to a small
village. He had left the cycle there, and walked over a low, scrub-covered hill and
down to the tunnel exit.
</p>
<p>Now he looked up. He had heard, in the distance, the shrill whistle of the engine. He
couldn’t see anything, because the train was approaching from the other side of the hill;
but presently a sound, like distant thunder, issued from the tunnel, and he knew the train
was coming through.</p>
<p>A second or two later, the steam-engine shot out of the tunnel, snorting and puffing
like some green, black and gold dragon, some beautiful monster out of Suraj’s dreams.
Showering sparks left and right, it roared a challenge to the jungle.
</p>
<p>Instinctively, Suraj stepped back a few paces. And then the train had gone, leaving
only a plume of smoke to drift lazily over tall shisham trees.
</p>
<p>The jungle was still again. No one moved. Suraj turned from his contemplation of
the drifting smoke and began walking along the embankment towards the tunnel.
</p>
<p>The tunnel grew darker as he walked further into it. When he had gone about twenty
yards, it became pitch black. Suraj had to turn and look back at the opening to reassure
himself that there was still daylight outside. Ahead of him, the tunnel’s other opening
was just a small round circle of light.
</p>
<p>The tunnel was still full of smoke from the train, but it would be several hours
before another train came through. Till then, it belonged to the jungle again.
</p>
<p>Suraj didn’t stop, because there was nothing to do in the tunnel and nothing to see.
He had simply wanted to walk through, so that he would know what the inside of a
tunnel was really like. The walls were damp and sticky. A bat flew past. A lizard
scuttled between the lines.</p>
<p>Coming straight from the darkness into the light, Suraj was dazzled by the sudden
glare. He put a hand up to shade his eyes and looked up at the tree-covered hillside. He
thought he saw something moving between the trees.</p>
<p>It was just a flash of orange and gold, and a long swishing tail. It was there between
the trees for a second or two, and then it was gone.
</p>
<p>About fifty feet from the entrance to the tunnel stood the watchman’s hut. Marigolds
grew in front of the hut, and at the back there was a small vegetable patch. It was the
watchman’s duty to inspect the tunnel and keep it clear of obstacles. Every day, before
the train came through, he would walk the length of the tunnel. If all was well, he would
return to his hut and take a nap. If something was wrong, he would walk back up the
line and wave a red flag and the engine-driver would slow down. At night, the
watchman lit an oil lamp and made a similar inspection of the tunnel. Of course, he
could not stop the train if there was a porcupine on the line. But if there was any danger
to the train, he’d go back up the line and wave his lamp to the approaching engine. If all
was well, he’d hang his lamp at the door of the hut and go to sleep.
</p>
<p>He was just settling down on his cot for an afternoon nap when he saw the boy
emerge from the tunnel. He waited until Suraj was only a few feet away and then said:
‘Welcome, welcome, I don’t often have visitors. Sit down for a while, and tell me why
you were inspecting my tunnel.’
</p>
<p>‘Is it your tunnel?’ asked Suraj.
</p>
<p>‘It is,’ said the watchman. ‘It is truly my tunnel, since no one else will have anything
to do with it. I have only lent it to the government.’
</p>
<p>Suraj sat down on the edge of the cot</p>
<p>‘I wanted to see the train come through,’ he said. ‘And then, when it had gone, I
thought I’d walk through the tunnel.’</p>
<p>‘And what did you find in it?’</p>
<p>‘Nothing. It was very dark. But when I came out, I thought I saw an animal – up on
the hill – but I’m not sure, it moved away very quickly.’</p>
<p>‘It was a leopard you saw,’ said the watchman. ‘My leopard.’
</p>
<p>‘Do you own a leopard too?’
</p>
<p>‘I do.’
</p>
<p>‘And do you lend it to the government?’</p>
<p>‘I do not.’</p>
<p>‘Is it dangerous?’
</p>
<p>‘No, it’s a leopard that minds its own business. It comes to this range for a few days
every month.’
</p>
<p>‘Have you been here a long time?’ asked Suraj.</p>
<p>‘Many years. My name is Sunder Singh.’</p>
<p>‘My name’s Suraj.’
</p>
<p>‘There’s one train during the day. And another during the night. Have you seen the
night mail come through the tunnel?’
</p>
<p>‘No. At what time does it come?’</p>
<p>‘About nine o’clock, if it isn’t late. You could come and sit here with me, if you like.
And after it has gone, I’ll take you home.’</p>
<p>‘I shall ask my parents,’ said Suraj. ‘Will it be safe?’</p>
<p>‘Of course. It’s safer in the jungle than in the town. Nothing happens to me out here,
but last month when I went into the town, I was almost run over by a bus.’
</p>
<p>Sunder Singh yawned and stretched himself out on the cot. ‘And now I’m going to
take a nap, my friend. It is too hot to be up and about in the afternoon.’</p>
<p>‘Everyone goes to sleep in the afternoon,’ complained Suraj. ‘My father lies down
as soon as he’s had his lunch.’</p>
<p>‘Well, the animals also rest in the heat of the day. It is only the tribe of boys who
cannot, or will not, rest.’
</p>
<p>Sunder Singh placed a large banana-leaf over his face to keep away the flies, and
was soon snoring gently. Suraj stood up, looking up and down the railway tracks. Then
he began walking back to the village.
</p>
<p>The following evening, towards dusk, as the flying foxes swooped silently out of the
trees, Suraj made his way to the watchman’s hut.
</p>
<p>It had been a long hot day, but now the earth was cooling, and a light breeze was
moving through the trees. It carried with it a scent of mango blossoms, the promise of
rain.
</p>
<p>Sunder Singh was waiting for Suraj. He had watered his small garden, and the
flowers looked cool and fresh. A kettle was boiling on a small oil-stove.</p>
<p>‘I’m making tea,’ he said. ‘There’s nothing like a glass of hot tea while waiting for a
train.’</p>
<p>They drank their tea, listening to the sharp notes of the tailorbird and the noisy
chatter of the seven-sisters. As the brief twilight faded, most of the birds fell silent.
Sunder Singh lit his oil-lamp and said it was time for him to inspect the tunnel. He
moved off towards the tunnel, while Suraj sat on the cot, sipping his tea. In the dark, the
trees seemed to move closer to him. And the night life of the forest was conveyed on the
breeze – the sharp call of a barking-deer, the cry of a fox, the quaint tonk-tonk of a
nightjar. There were some sounds that Suraj couldn’t recognise – sounds that came from
the trees, creakings and whisperings, as though the trees were coming alive, stretching
their limbs in the dark, shifting a little, reflexing their fingers.
</p>
<p>Sunder Singh stood inside the tunnel, trimming his lamp. The night sounds were
familiar to him and he did not give them much thought; but something else – a padded
footfall, a rustle of dry leaves – made him stand alert for a few seconds, peering into
the darkness. Then, humming softly to himself, he returned to where Suraj was waiting.
Another ten minutes remained for the night mail to arrive.
</p>
<p>As Sunder Singh sat down on the cot beside Suraj, a new sound reached both of
them quite distinctly – a rhythmic sawing sound, as if someone was cutting through the
branch of a tree.</p>
<p>‘What’s that?’ whispered Suraj.</p>
<p>‘It’s the leopard,’ said Sunder Singh.</p>
<p>‘I think it’s in the tunnel.’
</p>
<p>‘The train will soon be here,’ reminded Suraj.
</p>
<p>‘Yes, my friend. And if we don’t drive the leopard out of the tunnel, it will be run
over and killed. I can’t let that happen.’
</p>
<p>‘But won’t it attack us if we try to drive it out?’ asked Suraj, beginning to share the
watchman’s concern.
</p>
<p>‘Not this leopard. It knows me well. We have seen each other many times. It has a
weakness for goats and stray dogs, but it won’t harm us. Even so, I’ll take my axe with
me. You stay here, Suraj.’</p>
<p>‘No, I’m going with you. It’ll be better than sitting here alone in the dark!’
</p>
<p>‘All right, but stay close behind me. And remember, there’s nothing to fear.’
</p>
<p>Raising his lamp high, Sunder Singh advanced into the tunnel, shouting at the top of
his voice to try and scare away the animal. Suraj followed close behind, but he found
he was unable to do any shouting. His throat was quite dry</p>
<p>They had gone just about twenty paces into the tunnel when the light from the lamp
fell upon the leopard. It was crouching between the tracks, only fifteen feet away from
them. It was not a very big leopard, but it looked lithe and sinewy. Baring its teeth and
snarling, it went down on its belly, tail twitching.</p>
<p>Suraj and Sunder Singh both shouted together. Their voices rang through the tunnel.
And the leopard, uncertain as to how many terrifying humans were there in the tunnel
with him, turned swiftly and disappeared into the darkness.
</p>
<p>To make sure that it had gone, Sunder Singh and Suraj walked the length of the
tunnel. When they returned to the entrance, the rails were beginning to hum. They knew
the train was coming.</p>
<p>Suraj put his hand to the rails and felt its tremor. He heard the distant rumble of the
train. And then the engine came round the bend, hissing at them, scattering sparks into
the darkness, defying the jungle as it roared through the steep sides of the cutting. It
charged straight at the tunnel, and into it, thundering past Suraj like the beautiful dragon
of his dreams.
</p>
<p>And when it had gone, the silence returned and the forest seemed to breathe, to live
again. Only the rails still trembled with the passing of the train.</p>
<p>And they trembled to the passing of the same train, almost a week later, when Suraj
and his father were both travelling in it.
</p>
<p>Suraj’s father was scribbling in a notebook, doing his accounts. Suraj sat at an open
window staring out at the darkness. His father was going to Delhi on a business trip and
had decided to take the boy along. (‘I don’t know where he gets to, most of the time,’
he’d complained. ‘I think it’s time he learnt something about my business.’)
</p>
<p>The night mail rushed through the forest with its hundreds of passengers. Tiny
flickering lights came and went, as they passed small villages on the fringe of the
jungle.
</p>
<p>Suraj heard the rumble as the train passed over a small bridge. It was too dark to see
the hut near the cutting, but he knew they must be approaching the tunnel. He strained his
eyes looking out into the night; and then, just as the engine let out a shrill whistle, Suraj
saw the lamp.
</p>
<p>He couldn’t see Sunder Singh, but he saw the lamp, and he knew that his friend was
out there.</p>
<p>The train went into the tunnel and out again; it left the jungle behind and thundered
across the endless plains; and Suraj stared out at the darkness, thinking of the lonely
cutting in the forest, and the watchman with the lamp who would always remain a
firefly for those travelling thousands, as he lit up the darkness for steam-engines and
leopards.</p>
