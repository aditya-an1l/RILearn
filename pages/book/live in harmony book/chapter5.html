      <p>Chapter Five</p>
      <p> Feeling and Expressing Harmony through Art</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="side"> Chapter Inspiration:</p>
<p>“The purpose of art is to transmit to others the highest and best feelings to which
 human beings have risen.” –Count Leo Tolstoy
</p>
<p> “Art is man’s nature; nature is God’s art.” –Philip James Bailey
</p>
<p>“If you want to remain always happy, always perfect and always fulfilled, then
 always keep inside your heart a pocketful of sweet dreams.” –Sri Chinmoy
</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Story:</p>
<p> Claude Monet (1840-1926) was an artist who lived in France.  What
 Claude loved more than anything was to observe different kinds of light – morn
ing light, regular daylight, evening light, moonlight, starlight and even foggy
 light. Claude would pay close attention to the way that the light changed the
 objects that it touched.  He noticed that the light gave different feelings to objects– sometimes happy and bright, sometimes peaceful, sometimes sad, and some
times even scary. Then Claude painted the different kinds of light touching all
 kinds of things, such as bridges, rivers, oceans, gardens, farms, meadows and
 people.  One of his favorite things to paint was a flower.  He didn’t paint these
 things the way they were ‘supposed’ to look. Instead, he painted the deep feelings
 that the things gave him – especially when the light touched them. Claude became
 famous for his painting.   His style of painting was called Impressionism. When
 Claude was an old man, he became almost totally blind.  Still he was able to paint
 the most beautiful paintings even though he could hardly see.  Because he had
 painted the feelings of light for his whole life, he didn’t really need to see things
 anymore to be able to paint.  </p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview: 
</p>
<p>Enjoying art can be one of the best ways for us to feel harmony and to
 express ourselves.  There are many different kinds of art.  When we make some
thing with colors and shapes, it is called visual arts.  The visual arts include things
 like drawing, painting, sculpture and mosaics.  Every one of us sees the world in
 our own unique way, because we each have special feelings, ideas and dreams
 that nobody else has.  When we practice art we have a chance to create pictures of
 the world the way we see the world, and at the same time to express the feelings
 that we have about different things in the world.  Art is one way for us to connect
 to our inner world – who we are inside. When we have a chance to express our
selves through art, we feel harmony and a sense of accomplishment inside us. 
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 – Clay</p>
<p> To create a special atmosphere, play some peaceful, reflective music.  Dur
ing this activity, it is best if we all stay silent, so that we can focus on our work
 with the clay. We will need to cover our tables with plastic or newspapers, and we
 will need a cup of water for each student.  Take a piece of self-hardening clay and
 work with it for awhile. Clay comes directly from the earth.  It is part of the earth
 that you are touching.  What does it feel like?  Our bodies are made of the same
 elements that are in the clay and in the earth.  It is all the same substance.  We are
 connected to the earth because we are made of the same stuff.  So we are all con
nected to each other. Now try to shape the clay into something special. What did
 you make?  Share your sculpture with the class and share how you felt working
 with the clay.
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2 — Beeswax  
</p>
<p>Using colored beeswax, make a mini sculpture of yourself and of some
body or something that is very close to you.  It can be a person you love or a pet
 that is very special to you.  It can be a stuffed animal or an object that is special
 to you.  (Note that you will have to soften the beeswax first by making it warm in
 your hands and fingers.)  When working with beeswax you can make very small
 parts and fine objects if you just have a little patience.  It also helps to move your
 fingers gently and in small motions.  Working with beeswax is very fine work!
 What is special about the thing you made into a sculpture?  What kind of connec
tion do you feel with that special person or object?  Make a display of all the dif
ferent sculptures.  You can label the sculptures with a title and with your name.
 For example: ‘My Grandma and Me, by Andrea.’ You won’t need lots of space todisplay your beeswax sculptures.  They are so tiny!
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #3 — Watercolors (a). Paint with just one color</p>
<p>Choose one color you want to work with.  First dip your paintbrush into
 the water.   Then just move your paintbrush back and forth on the paper, and get a
 feeling for how the brush moves across the wet paper.  You can make a beautiful
 painting without any color at all – just using the water!  Now dip your brush into
 the color you want to use.  You will use only one color for this lesson.  Use the
 watercolor paint to gently put swatches of your color onto the paper.  You will see
 that the paint will go onto the paper in dark and light shades.  Pay attention to the
 different shades and to how one color can have so many different variations!</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #4 — Watercolors (b). Paint your favorite time of day</p>
<p>For this activity you will use two or three colors.  What is your favorite
 time of day?  Choose the colors that will be best to paint the light at this time of
 day.  Follow the instructions in Lesson #3 to prepare your paper and to begin
 painting. Try to paint the light at your favorite time of day.  Pay special attention
 to the feelings that you get when you think of that time of day.  Try to paint those
 feelings into your picture – just like Claude Monet did!</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #5 – Using pastels</p>
<p> Go to visit some cherry or apple trees when they are in blossom, or go to
 visit some daffodils or lilacs nearby. You can also bring cherry blossoms, apple
 blossoms or other flowers into the classroom.  Use the pastels on your art paper to
 try to express the feelings of the colors and fragrance of the flowers. Share or dis
play your work – it doesn’t have to be ‘perfect.’</p>
<p class="side"> Discussion Questions:</p>
<p> a) Discuss the first quotation.  What do you think Leo Tolstoy meant by the
 “highest and best feeling to which human beings have risen”?  Can you give some
 examples?</p>
<p> b) Discuss what you think the first part of the second quotation means, when it
 says, “Art is man’s nature.”  What about the second part?</p>
<p> c) Gather some prints of Impressionist paintings.  Can you name some of the
 other Impressionist painters?  What do their paintings have in common?  Did all
 of the Impressionist painters see light in the same way?  Were they expressing the
 same feelings?
</p>
<p class="side"> Supplemental Activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Claude Monet saw the world and painted the world in his own unique way.
 What is special about the way you see the world?  Close your eyes and visualize a
 place in nature.  It could be a place you have visited that has stuck in your memo
ry, or even a place that you have seen only in a picture. What is special about this
 place?  Why do you remember it so vividly? What do you feel about this place?
 Now open your eyes and draw or paint this place the way you experienced it or
 remember it. Don’t draw or paint what it is supposed to look like.  Draw or paint
 what you saw that nobody else could see. Draw or paint what you feel about this
 place.</p>
</li>
<li> <p>Making a mask of yourself: Use papier mache, clay, or some other material to
 make a mask of yourself.  Paint the mask according to how the best or happiest
 part of you looks.  In other words, paint your face when you are your brightest
 self.  What does the best part of you look like?</p></li>
</ul>
