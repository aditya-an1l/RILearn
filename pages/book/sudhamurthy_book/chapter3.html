      <p>Abdul Kalam</p>
    </h1>
    <img src="Screenshot 2025-02-09 003751.png" alt="image">
    <p> I have been writing columns for a number of newspapers and magazines for a while
      now. One of them was The Week magazine. Writing columns is not an
      easy job. One has to keep coming up with interesting anecdotes to write
      about. Sometimes the incident is so nice you feel like writing more but you
      have to be careful about the word limit. Sometimes you don't get any ideas at
      all, though the deadline may be nearing. Only very few gifted people can
      write regular columns for a long time.</p>

    <p> Once I wrote a column for The Week on the role of Information Technology
      in people's lives. It was called 'IT Divide'. It was based on a true incident that
      once happened to me.</p>

    <p> Soon after the column appeared, one morning I got a call from Delhi. The
      operator said, 'Shri Abdul Kalam wants to talk to you.'</p>

    <p> That time Abdul Kalam was principal scientific secretary to the
      Government of India. I had never met him in person till then. I had only read
      about him in the papers and seen him on TV. Of course I started wondering
      why a person of his stature would want to talk to an ordinary person like me.
      We had nothing in common. It would be like a meeting between a Himalayan
      peak and the peak of Unkal Hill, which is in the small town of Hubli in north
      Karnataka.</p>

    <p> When Abdul Kalam came on the line I said, 'Sir, there is a mistake by the
      operator. Perhaps you want to speak to my husband, Narayana Murthy?' I
      knew Murthy knew Mr. Kalam. From the other end a soft, affectionate voice
      replied, 'Vanakkam, there is absolutely no mistake. I told the operator to
      connect to you only.'</p>

    <p> I was thrilled.</p>
    <p> 'Sir, you don't know me but I know a lot about you. I have read about your
      life in the book Wings of Fire.' </p>

    <p> 'But I too know about you by reading your columns. I read Ananda Vikatan
      regularly where you talk about your dreams and your struggles. Today when I
      read 'IT Divide' in The Week, I laughed and laughed. You have written on a
      tough topic in such a humorous way! I called my colleagues in the office and
      told them to read the column. Normally whenever your columns appear, I
      read the last paragraph first because it contains the gist. Then I read the
      remaining portion as and when I get time.'</p>

    <p> That was the best compliment I had ever received. When I write, I always
      think of the end first and then the beginning. Kalam seemed to have guessed
      that in no time.</p>

    <p> I had heard from many people that he is extremely simple, wears only
      white and blue shirts and slippers. Soon I got to know that this was not an
      exaggeration. After our talk on the phone I met him several times. Till today,
      the more I meet him, the more I am convinced about the essential simplicity
      of the man. Any interaction with him is a joy and I always look forward to
      that.</p>

    <p> I met him for the first time in Bangalore. He sent me word that he wanted
      to see me though he had a packed schedule. I was waiting for him in a room
      when he came in, looking cool inspite of a long tough day. For a while we
      talked about literature and human qualities. He asked me in chaste Tamil,
      'How come you know such good Tamil?'</p>

    <p> 'No sir,' I replied, 'I can't speak Tamil whereas I can understand. My
      translator, Mr. Arokia Velu is an excellent translator. The credit for what
      appears in Ananda Vikatan should go to him.'</p>

    <p> As we chatted, a man without a prior appointment wanted to enter. Kalam's
      security personnel were reluctant to let him enter. Finally Mr. Kalam said,
      'Please allow him. It does not matter. He might have come from a long
      distance.'</p>

    <p> A middle-aged man entered the room along with a photographer. He was
      holding a huge album and a bag. He told Kalam, 'Sir, I own this institution,'
      and kept the album in front of him. 'Please come for our prize distribution
      day. It will be a great honour for all of us.'</p>

    <p> Kalam looked at a few pages of the album and said, 'I am short of time so I
      will not be able to make it. May God bless the children.'</p>

    <p> Then the man requested for a photograph with Kalam, to which he agreed
      immediately. The gentleman took a pink-coloured shawl from his bag and
      told the photographer to take his photo while he was laying the shawl
      on Kalam's shoulder.</p>

    <p> The photograph was duly taken and Kalam thanked him and continued
      talking to me. But my attention was still on the man. I noticed that he took
      back the shawl and walked out of the room. I could not control my anger.,/p>

    <p> 'Sir, he has taken the shawl which he presented to you.'
      Kalam smiled at me and said, 'It does not matter. I don't need any one of
      them. Probably he needs it.'</p>

    <p>Each time I meet him, I am amazed at his straightforward behaviour and
      his secular outlook. He has a compassionate heart which particularly loves all
      children.</p>

    <p> After that meeting, whenever I was in Chennai, I would see him in his
      chamber in Anna University where he was teaching. We would talk about
      many issues, the main one being about education, particularly in the rural
      areas. He is extremely grateful to his teachers and holds them in the highest
      respect.</p>

    <p> Once I was sharing my experiences in Chandipur, Orissa and a lesson I
      learnt from a young fisherboy called Javed. He was a poor schoolboy who
      helped his mother sell red crabs. For an entire day's work he received only Rs
      5. Yet he was happy and enthusiastic. When I asked him how he could always
      remain so optimistic, he said, 'It is better to be worn out than to be rusted.'</p>

    <p> As soon as I told this story to him, Kalam wrote Javed's words down on a
      piece of paper and exclaimed what a great piece of advice it was. He told me
      that he likes Orissa immensely, as he had spent many years in that state doing
      missile tests. </p>

    <p> 'If you are doing something in Orissa I will definitely come. I know you
      work there and that state is very dear to your heart too.'</p>

    <p> Once, I decided to visit Rameshwaram, along with a group of friends.
      When Kalam got to know, he was very eager to go with us as it is his birth
      place. He said he would join us in Madurai railway station. He had made all
      the arrangements when his nomination for the post of President of India was
      announced. He told me, 'We will keep the plan open for Rameshwaram.'</p>

    <p> By this time I was sure he was going to be the President of India
      irrespective of the election. We could not ask him to join us as it could be
      major security problem for him. Sadly I had to tell him, 'No sir, please do not
      come. We will go on our own.'</p>

    <p> By the time we returned from the trip, he had, as I had predicted, been
      elected the President. He invited me to his swearing-in ceremony in the
      central hall of Parliament. What I saw when I stepped into the hall amazed
      me. It was filled with children, teachers, his family members, odd people like
      me and Father George, who used to be my student in Bangalore and then was
      doing his research under Kalam in Anna University.</p>

    <p> It was a most unusual oath-taking ceremony. Everyone seemed to be close
      to Kalam. Normally such ceremonies are attended by industrialists, politicians
      and other VIPs. But here there were students, teachers, scientists, ordinary
      middle-class people and friends of Kalam. I saw Mrinalini Sarabhai, whose
      husband the late Dr Vikram Sarabhai was also a great scientist and knew
      Kalam well. Her sister, Captain Laxmi had contested against Kalam for the
      post of President. She too was present in the audience.</p>

    <p> I came away from the function feeling deeply moved by the love I saw
      everyone showering on Kalam. After a few months, I asked my son, who is a
      teenager, to meet Kalam.</p>

    <p> My son said, 'Amma, he is the President of our country. He is a learned and
      well respected scientist. He is a very busy man. What will he talk about to a
      person like me?'</p>

    <p> 'Child, please understand. I knew him before he became the President and I
      have met him after he became President. There is absolutely no change. He
      loves talking to people of your age. That is his mission. He interacts with
      children through email and chat. That is the reason I want you to meet him.
      Learn from him those qualities which you will never learn in any university.'</p>

    <p> Somehow my son was not very convinced. 'He is too big a man for me,' he
      muttered.</p>

    <p> Nevertheless, he was there when we had dinner with Kalam. For the next
      two hours they hijacked the entire conversation. Murthy and I could only sit
      and listen. They discussed the best operating systems for computers, the great
      Tamil saint Thiruvalvar and his teachings, the future of the children of India,
      teaching methodologies in America, etc. After he left, my son told me,
      'Amma, I never felt that I was talking to the President of India. Rather, it was
      like talking to my grandfather whom I loved so much and lost four years
      back. Amma, what you said was true and not at all an exaggeration.'</p>

    <p> When Kalam went by train on a tour of Bihar, he invited me to go with him
      along with five other friends. There I saw another face of Kalam. He would
      work more than all of us. His schedule would start at 6.30 or 7 a.m. and end at
      10.30 or 11 p.m. At seventy-one years he was tireless and the most
      enthusiastic person in the team all of whom were much younger to him.</p>

    <p> He would regularly address large groups of students followed by question
      answer sessions. He would take individual questions and answer them. Then
      he would make children recite some of the important lines after him. He
      reminded me of a loving schoolteacher or a doting grandfather or an excellent
      friend to these children irrespective of the difference in age.</p>

    <p> During Bangalore's IT.Com I watched him taking an internet class for
      thousand students. He held their complete attention and was excellently
      prepared.</p>

    <p> When we built a 150-bed Paediatric Hospital in Bhubaneshwar, Orissa for
      poor children, I was very keen that he should come and inaugurate it. I
      remembered his promise made to me in Chennai that he would come to Orissa
      if I invited him. But now he was the President of India, and there were many
      people like me inviting him to similar functions. He was no longer a professor
      at Anna University whom I could approach on telephone or send an email and
      convey my message. However, remembering his promise, I sent him an email
      assuming it may not reach. But within a few days, I got a reply from his
      secretary saying that he had agreed to inaugurate the hospital. Coincidentally,
      it was the eve of Buddha Poornima, May 15, 2003. I have heard many stories
      about Buddha who was born 2,500 years ago. I was fortunate that this great
      teacher and lover of children could at least inaugurate and appreciate our effort.</p>
