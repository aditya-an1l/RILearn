      <p>Chapter Eight</p>
      <p> Building Harmony through Affirmations</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="side"> Chapter Inspiration: </p>
<p>“The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.” –Marcus
 Aurelius Antoninus
</p>
<p> “The language of the heart is the only language that everybody can understand.”–Sri Chinmoy
</p>
<p> “I am the greatest.” –Muhammad Ali 
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Story:</p>
<p> Muhammad Ali grew up in a very poor section of Louisville, Kentucky.  In
 those days his name was Cassius Clay.  His family did not have very much
 money.  One of his only possessions was his bicycle. He loved his bicycle and he
 loved to ride all over the neighborhood. One day somebody took his bicycle from
 the front of his house.  He was very sad but he was determined to get his bicycle
 back.  Cassius went looking for his bicycle at the local Boys’ Club.  There he did
 not find his bicycle, but he saw some young boys who were practicing boxing.
 He could not take his eyes off them.  He watched how they moved their arms and
 their feet.  He watched their eyes and how they breathed.  It was as if Cassius
 were in a trance.   He forgot all about his bicycle.  He felt a powerful feeling well
 up in his heart.  Suddenly he said to himself,  “I want to be a boxer.  I can
 become a great boxer.  I will be the greatest boxer of all time!” He asked the box
ing coach if he could take lessons. </p>
<p>In 1960, Cassius Clay won the Olympic gold medal in boxing. Then he
 went on to also become the professional champion of the world. When he con
verted to the Muslim religion, Cassius changed his name to Muhammad Ali, to
 show that he was making a new commitment in his life. From the age of twelve,
 and continuing throughout his boxing career, he repeated his affirmation, “I am
 the greatest,” thousands and thousands of times.  This helped him tremendously
 to believe in his goal.  Lo and behold, he achieved his goal.  He became the
 greatest!
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview: 
</p>
<p>Affirmations are like messages we give to ourselves.  When Mohammad
 Ali said, “I am the greatest,” it might sound as if he were bragging.  What he was
 actually doing was giving himself a positive message.  The message was that
 even though he was very, very poor, even though he was not good at school, even
 if nobody else believed in him, he still could be a champion if he believed in him
self.   
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 – Your first affirmation  
</p>
<p>Here is your first affirmation to practice:
</p>
<p> There are so many good things in me—
</p>
<p> I just close my eyes to clearly see.</p>
<p> I am a good person, even if I sometimes make mistakes.  What are some of
 the good things about you?  Put them into a picture or a poem or even just a list.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2  — Speaking the truth</p>
<p> I try to speak the truth and do what’s right.</p>
<p> I soar with integrity, like an eagle in flight.</p>
<p> Do you stand up for yourself?  It takes a lot of courage to say how you feel
 or to say, ‘no,’ if you feel something is wrong.  Using some role-plays to create
 different situations, practice telling someone how you feel or practice telling
 someone ‘no.’</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #3 — Achievement</p>
<p> There are no limits to what I can achieve,</p>
<p> If I work hard and just believe.</p>
<p> I can do anything I want to in my life, if I believe in myself and if I work
 hard.  What is something you would like to achieve?  Close your eyes and imag-
ine yourself doing it.  Now repeat the affirmation while you are holding this
 image of you!!!

</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #4 – Good and bad feelings  </p>
<p>Feelings come and visit me,</p>
 <p>Happy, or sad, or maybe angry. </p>
<p>There are many things that I can feel,</p>
 <p>And all of them are really real.</p>
 <p>I let bad feelings go away —</p>
 <p>Feelings that are good can always stay.</p>
<p>Our feelings are part of who we are, yet our feelings change from day to
 day or even from minute to minute.  Try to be aware of what you feel right now.
 Can you say what feeling you are experiencing right now?  Are you happy, sad,
 angry or frustrated?   This is called owning your feelings or being with your feel
ings.  Being present to your feelings in this way is very healthy and empowering.
 Share your feelings with the class or with a partner – only if you want to.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #5 – A magical day
</p>
<p>Today can be a magical day, 
</p>
<p>Cheerful and positive I will stay.</p>
<p> Our thoughts are very powerful.   To a great degree, we can shape the kind
 of experience we are going to have by being conscious of our thoughts.  If we can
 say a positive affirmation at the start of each day, it can help us to get started on a
 positive note.  Create some mini skits to show the power of positive and negative
 thoughts.
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #6  — Accepting people who are different
</p>
<p> I do not see people as black or white,
</p>
<p> I see in every heart a special light.</p>
<p> This affirmation can be very helpful in shaping an accepting attitude
 towards others.  Inside of everyone is the same kind of invisible heart.  It is
 important to remind ourselves of this every day.  Try making a group picture with
 this affirmation written at the top.  This will be a good way to cooperate and to
 share your feelings about the meaning of the affirmation.
</p>
<p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
<p> a) When he was a child he was called Cassius Clay. Later in his life, when he
 converted to the Muslim religion, Cassius changed his name to Muhammad Ali.
 Do you know anyone who is a Muslim?  A Muslim is someone who believes in
 the teachings of the prophet Muhammad, which are written in a book called the
 Koran. When and where did the prophet Muhammad live?  
</p>
<p>b) Did you ever lose something and then, when you went looking for it, you
 found or discovered something else?</p>
 <p> c) Did you like practicing affirmations?  Do you think it would be good or helpful
 to practice them more often? </p>
 <p>d) What was your favorite affirmation? Can you say why?</p>
 <p class="side"> Supplemental Activities:</p>
 <ul>
    <li><p>Borrow a copy of the Koran from a Muslim friend.  Show it to the class – the
 beautiful cover and binding, the pages, and the special writing, which is usually
 Arabic.  If it also has an English translation, choose a part of the Koran to read to
 the class.</p></li>
 <li><p>Gather some books and videos about Muhammad Ali.  These can be shared by
 the class.  There are many lessons to be learned from the life of this amazing
 man.</p></li>
 <li><p>Create an affirmation that is special to you. Write it down in beautiful handwrit
ing on a special piece of paper.  Then decorate the paper with crayons, markers,
 colored pencils or other art materials.</p></li>
 <li> <p>There are many books that are collections of useful affirmations.  You can bor
row one of them from the library if you want to learn more about affirmations.</p></li>
