      <p>How I Taught My Grandmother to Read</p>
    </h1>
    <img src="Screenshot 2025-02-09 002815.png" alt="image">
    <p>When I was a girl of about twelve, I used to stay in a village in north
      Karnataka with my grandparents. Those days, the transport system was not
      very good, so we used to get the morning paper only in the afternoon. The
      weekly magazine used to come one day late. All of us would wait eagerly for
      the bus, which used to come with the papers, weekly magazines and the post</p>

    <p>At that time, Triveni was a very popular writer in the Kannada language.
      She was a wonderful writer. Her style was easy to read and very convincing.
      Her stories usually dealt with complex psychological problems in the lives of
      ordinary people and were always very interesting. Unfortunately for Kannada
      literature, she died very young. Even now, after forty years, people continue
      to appreciate her novels.</p>

    <p>One of her novels, called Kashi Yatre, was appearing as a serial in the
      Kannada weekly Karmaveera then. It is the story of an old lady and her
      ardent desire to go to Kashi or Varanasi. Most Hindus believe that going to
      Kashi and worshipping Lord Vishweshvara is the ultimate punya. This old
      lady also believed in this, and her struggle to go there was described in that
      novel. In the story there was also a young orphan girl who falls in love but
      there was no money for the wedding. In the end, the old lady gives away all
      her savings without going to Kashi. She says, ‘The happiness of this orphan
      girl is more important than worshipping Lord Vishweshwara at Kashi.’</p>

    <p>My grandmother, Krishtakka, never went to school so she could not read.
      Every Wednesday the magazine would come and I would read the next
      episode of this story to her. During that time she would forget all her work
      and listen with the greatest concentration. Later, she could repeat the entire
      text by heart. My grandmother too never went to Kashi, and she identified
      herself with the novel’s protagonist. So more than anybody else she was the
      one most interested in knowing what happened next in the story and used to
      insist that I read the serial out to her.</p>

    <p>After hearing what happened next in Kashi Yatre, she would join her
      friends at the temple courtyard where we children would also gather to play
      hide and seek. She would discuss the latest episode with her friends. At that
      time, I never understood why there was so much of debate about the story.</p>

    <p>Once I went for a wedding with my cousins to the neighbouring village. In
      those days, a wedding was a great event. We children enjoyed ourselves
      thoroughly. We would eat and play endlessly, savouring the freedom because
      all the elders were busy. I went for a couple of days but ended up staying
      there for a week.</p>

    <p>When I came back to my village, I saw my grandmother in tears. I was
      surprised, for I had never seen her cry even in the most difficult situations.
      What had happened? I was worried.</p>

    <p>‘Avva, is everything all right? Are you ok?’
      I used to call her Avva, which means mother in the Kannada spoken in
      north Karnataka.</p>

    <p>She nodded but did not reply. I did not understand and forgot about it. In
      the night, after dinner, we were sleeping in the open terrace of the house. It
      was a summer night and there was a full moon. Avva came and sat next to
      me. Her affectionate hands touched my forehead. I realized she wanted to
      speak. I asked her, ‘What is the matter?’</p>

    <p>‘When I was a young girl I lost my mother. There was nobody to look after
      and guide me. My father was a busy man and got married again. In those days
      people never considered education essential for girls, so I never went to
      school. I got married very young and had children. I became very busy. Later
      I had grandchildren and always felt so much happiness in cooking and
      feeding all of you. At times I used to regret not going to school, so I made
      sure that my children and grandchildren studied well …’</p>

    <p>I could not understand why my sixty-two-year-old grandmother was telling
      me, a twelve-year-old, the story of her life in the middle of the night. But I
      knew I loved her immensely and there had to be some reason why she was
      talking to me. I looked at her face. It was unhappy and her eyes were filled
      with tears. She was a good-looking lady who was usually always smiling.
      Even today I cannot forget the worried expression on her face. I leaned
      forward and held her hand.</p>

    <p>‘Avva, don’t cry. What is the matter? Can I help you in any way?’
      ‘Yes, I need your help. You know when you were away, Karmaveera came
      as usual. I opened the magazine. I saw the picture that accompanies the story
      of Kashi Yatre and I could not understand anything that was written. Many
      times I rubbed my hands over the pages wishing they could understand what
      was written. But I knew it was not possible. If only I was educated enough. I
      waited eagerly for you to return. I felt you would come early and read for me.</p>

    <p>I even thought of going to the village and asking you to read for me. I could
      have asked somebody in this village but I was too embarrassed to do so. I felt
      so very dependent and helpless. We are well-off, but what use is money when
      I cannot be independent?’</p>

    <p>I did not know what to answer. Avva continued.</p>

    <p>‘I have decided I want to learn the Kannada alphabets from tomorrow
      onwards. I will work very hard. I will keep Saraswati Pooja day during
      Dassara as the deadline. That day I should be able to read a novel on my own.
      I want to be independent.’</p>

    <p>I saw the determination on her face. Yet I laughed at her.
      ‘Avva, at this age of sixty-two you want to learn alphabets? All your hair
      are grey, your hands are wrinkled, you wear spectacles and you work so much
      in the kitchen…’</p>

    <p>Childishly I made fun of the old lady. But she just smiled.
      ‘For a good cause if you are determined, you can overcome any obstacle. I
      will work harder than anybody but I will do it. For learning there is no age
      bar.’</p>

    <p>The next day onwards I started my tuition. Avva was a wonderful student.
      The amount of homework she did was amazing. She would read, repeat, write
      and recite. I was her only teacher and she was my first student. Little did I
      know then that one day I would become a teacher in Computer Science and
      teach hundreds of students.</p>

    <p>The Dassara festival came as usual. Secretly I bought Kashi Yatre which
      had been published as a novel by that time. My grandmother called me to the
      puja place and made me sit down on a stool. She gave me a gift of a frock
      material. Then she did something unusual. She bent down and touched my
      feet. I was surprised and taken aback. Elders never touch the feet of
      youngsters. We have always touched the feet of God, elders and teachers. We
      consider that as a mark of respect. It is a great tradition but today the reverse
      had happened. It was not correct.</p>

    <p>She said, ‘I am touching the feet of a teacher, not my grand daughter; a
      teacher who taught me so well, with so much of affection that I can read any
      novel confidently in such a short period. Now I am independent. It is my duty
      to respect a teacher. Is it not written in our scriptures that a teacher should be
      respected, irrespective of the gender and age?’
      I did return namaskara to her by touching her feet and gave my gift to my
      first student. She opened it and read immediately the title Kashi Yatre by
      Triveni and the publisher’s name.</p>
    <p>I knew then that my student had passed with flying colours.</p>
