      <p>Chapter Three</p>
      <p> Learning about Our Feelings</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="side"> Chapter Inspiration:</p>
<p>“Love is our highest word and the synonym of God.”  —Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
<p> “There are two elements that go to the composition of friendship.  One is truth
 (sincerity) and the other is tenderness.”  —Ralph Waldo Emerson
</p>
<p> “Understanding is the knowledge that suffering is shared by everyone. When you
 understand that you aren’t alone in your suffering, there is the birth of love.
 When there is love there is the opportunity for peace.”  —Deepak Chopra
</p>
<p> “Friendship is the soil where happiness proudly grows.” –Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Story:</p>
<p> Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) lived in Denmark.  When he was a
 child, Hans was not a very happy person.  Other children teased him because he
 looked different and did not like to play some of the most popular games.  Chil
dren made fun of Hans because he did not act quite the same as everybody else.
 He preferred reading to playing on the playground.  Hans was a very sensitive
 young boy.  Because he was different he didn’t have many friends.  He felt alone
 and because he was alone he felt sad.  When other children teased Hans, it made
 him feel even more lonely and sad. When he felt lonely and sad it made him want
 to stay away from others even more.  This cycle continued, and Hans went
 through many years like this, feeling bad about himself, feeling alone, and feeling
 ugly.
 
</p>
<p> Hans Christian Andersen had experiences and feelings like many young
 children have when they are growing up.  He had many of the same feelings that
 many people do.  He could have kept these feelings inside without ever sharing
 them, but usually this is not very healthy.  He could have told a good friend about
 how he was feeling, but maybe Hans didn’t have a good friend.  Instead, Hans
 Christian Andersen did something different, something very special, with his feel
ings. He started writing stories that described different situations that might cause
 different kinds of feelings.  Most of his stories were about animals that had human feelings. The animals could also talk and solve problems and do other
 things that normal animals cannot do.  Hans wrote over 200 stories in all, and
 eventually he became very famous for his stories.
</p>
<p> Writing stories became the way for Hans to express his feelings. One of his
 most well-known stories is called The Ugly Duckling.  It is the story of a baby
 duck who doesn’t look like any of the other baby ducks, and who gets teased and
 set apart from everybody else.  The Ugly Duckling is about someone who feels
 very sad and lonely because he is different – just like the way Hans himself used
 to feel when he was young.  Writing this story helped Hans to realize that feeling
 lonely and sad is something that happens to everyone; that these feelings are part
 of being human. 
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview: </p>
<p>Learning about feelings is one of the most helpful things that we can do in
 order to understand ourselves and accept others.  All people have the same kinds
 of feelings, but we don’t all have the same feelings at the same time. Hans Christ
ian Andersen learned to express his feelings in a positive and useful way by writ
ing stories.  Writing stories was how Hans was able to put his feelings into per
spective so he could understand them better.  It was how Hans was able to move
 through his different feelings, to learn from them and to grow.  The stories Hans
 wrote were about feelings he actually had, or maybe about feelings that he saw in
 other people.  Through his writing, Hans learned something that helps all of us 
that learning to become aware of our feelings and learning to understand them
 empowers us to channel our feelings in creative ways.  In this way Hans Christian
 Andersen is a good role model for us, because there is much we can learn from
 his life.  In this chapter we will learn about feelings, how to recognize them,
 make friends with them, understand them, and work with them in creative ways,
 to help us meet our goals.
</p>
<p class="side"> Chapter Lessons:
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1— Naming feelings
</p>
<p> The first step in learning about feelings is learning their names. Feelings
 are also sometimes called emotions.  Feelings and emotions are the same thing.
 There are some basic feelings that every human being feels at one time or anther.
 Here they are: compassion, fulfillment, happiness, peace, love, anger, frustration,
 sadness, fear, and hate. </p>
<p>Compassion: a loving connection to another person or group of people. Another
 word for compassion is empathy.</p>
<p> Fulfillment: a feeling of accomplishment deep inside us. Another word for fulfill
ment is satisfaction.</p>
<p> Happiness: a feeling of fullness inside us. Another word for happiness is joy. </p>
<p>Peace: a feeling of calm and tranquillity throughout our body, mind, emotions
 and spirit. Another word for peace is serenity.</p>
<p> Love: a strong, deep affection or liking for somebody or something, which
 engages your thoughts and your whole self in a powerful and potentially creative
 way. </p>
<p>Anger: a mean or hurtful feeling toward someone else, usually because of some
thing we think that person did to us. Another word for angry is mad.</p>
<p> Frustration: a feeling of being blocked, like there is an obstacle in our path.</p>
<p> Sadness: a feeling of emptiness or loss, as if we are missing something.</p>
<p>Fear: a feeling that something bad or dangerous is about to happen. A feeling that
 causes our whole being to be upset.  Other words for fear are anxiety and worry.
</p>
<p> Hate: a very strong and deep disaffection or dislike for somebody or something,
 which engages our thoughts and our whole self in a powerful and potentially
 destructive way.  </p>
<p>We can also think of the basic human feelings as pairs of opposites:
 ‘Positive’ Feelings
 ‘Negative’ Feelings
 compassion ...................................…....anger
 fulfillment.............................................frustration
 happiness...............................................sadness
 peace.....................................................fear
 love........................................................hate
</p>
<p> Some feelings are positive — meaning they are productive, helpful and
 creative.  Positive feelings give us energy, make us feel good and help the good
 things inside us to come out.  Other feelings are negative – meaning they are not
 productive; they can be hurtful or destructive. Negative feelings take energy from us, usually make us feel bad, and can block us from expressing our good quali
ties.  However all feelings – both positive and negative ones – are necessary and
 vital parts of who we are.  If we learn to accept all of them, then we can use them
 all to learn and to grow.  Thinking of our feelings in terms of opposites helps us
 to become more aware of what we are feeling at certain times. It can also help us
 to move through a certain negative feeling by thinking of the opposite feeling.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2 (a)– Becoming aware of our feelings: What is going on inside?
</p>
<p>  Becoming aware of what you are feeling at any given time is a powerful
 skill to learn.  It is something that can help you to keep your feelings in balance,
 and to use your feelings in productive and creative ways.  Close your eyes for a
 few moments and ask yourself: “What feeling or feelings do I have inside of me
 right now?”  The teacher can read or say the basic feelings so that you can
 remember the names.  Try to become aware of which one or ones you are feeling
 at this moment.  Once you have identified it, you can complete this sentence: I am
 feeling ____________ because_____________.  After the ‘because,’ you can
 think of or say a reason.  Sometimes there is no reason that you can identify or
 think of. In that case you can complete the sentence by saying because ‘that’s just
 how I am feeling right now.’ If you did find a reason for your feelings you can
 use some of the methods of lessons #3 and 4 below to help you to process them.
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2 (b)– Becoming aware of our feelings: The three minds</p>
<p> Pumsy the Dragon is a character, in a book by the same name, created by
 author Jill Anderson (Timberline Press). Pumsy the Dragon is a creature who goes
 on an adventure and learns valuable lessons about herself. One of the important
 things Pumsy learns on her journey is about the three minds.
</p>
<p> The Clear Mind: </p>
 <p>This is how our mind is when we feel calm and peaceful inside; when we
 are feeling safe and secure and good about ourselves. When we are in the clear
 mind we see the world as a happy place, and we see other people as partners and
 friends who want to play with us, work with us, and help us.
</p>
<p> The Mud Mind: 
</p>
<p>This is how our mind is when we feel anxious and worried inside.  In the
 Mud Mind we do not feel safe or secure. We don’t feel very good about our
selves. When we are in the Mud Mind, we see the world as a scary or lonely
 place and we see other people as competitors or threats to us who want to take
 something from us or make us do things we don’t want to do.</p>
<p>The Sparkler Mind: 
</p>
<p>This is how our mind is when our inner world is full of spontaneous cre
ativity.  There are no blocks or obstacles to the flow of transforming energy and
 new ideas.  When we are in the Sparkler Mind, we can tap into the universe of
 knowledge and creativity. </p>
<p>If we follow the lessons of Pumsy the Dragon, we can become aware of
 the three minds and we can identify which mind we are in.  We can use the les
sons of Pumsy as well as the lessons in this chapter, to help us move out of our
 Mud Mind and into our Clear Mind and our Sparkler Mind.  Can you think of and
 share examples of when you were in the different ‘minds’ of Pumsy?   What
 ‘mind’ are you in today?
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #3 — Balancing and channelling feelings</p>
<p> Once we know the names of feelings and we know how to recognize them
 when they are happening inside us, the next lesson is to learn what to do with
 them.  The first step is to realize that we are responsible for all of our feelings.
 Nobody can make us feel the way we do.  We are the ones who choose to feel
 what we feel.</p>
<p> Sometimes, though, it is hard to get out of negative feelings. When we are
 feeling sad, angry, or frustrated, some of the activities that can help us are: drawing
 or other art activities; singing or playing a musical instrument; writing; or doing
 various kinds of fitness activities.  We could call them ‘unsticking’ activities
 because they help us to get unstuck from bad feelings. Most people already have
 their own ways of getting unstuck, of dealing with negative feelings. What is your
 way?  What activities do you do to get out of negative feelings you feel stuck in?
 When we do these kinds of activities, we bring our life into balance, so that we
 don’t feel overwhelmed by negative feelings.  We also get a kind of clarity in our
 mind about how to get unstuck. </p>
<p>Finally, when we do these activities we can begin to channel our energy to
 accomplish the things we want to accomplish. Write in your journal about your
 favorite activity – a sport, martial art, game, creative work, or other activity – and
 about how doing your favorite thing helps you to get ‘unstuck’ from negative
 feelings.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #4 – Speaking our feelings </p>
<p>If we think our feelings have to do with something another person did,
 then it is important to try to talk to that person about it as honestly as possible.  If
 we hold negative feelings inside us and never speak about them, that can be
unhealthy and bring us anxiety or even health problems.  </p>
<p>Try to arrange a time to speak with the person whom you feel has upset
 you.  Try using ‘I’ messages when you talk.  For example: “I felt hurt because
 you didn’t play with me at recess.”  Once you share your feelings, ask the person
 if they understand what you are saying. Invite them to repeat back to you what
 you have shared to make sure they ‘got it right.’ Then invite them to tell you how
 they feel about the situation. You might be surprised at what you feel.  </p>
<p>Break into groups of three to practice sharing feelings about different situa
tions.  You can invent situations or you can use real situations in your class or
 school if you feel ready.  Each team member should practice sharing feelings with
 one other team member, while the third person always watches to make sure that:
 a)  ‘I’ messages are being used; b) team members are regularly repeating back
 what they hear; and c) all members have an equal amount of time to share their
 feelings.</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #5 — Listening for other people’s feelings: Jackal ears vs. giraffe ears*</p>
<p> Listening to other people’s feelings is hard at first.  We often have such
 strong feelings or stiff ideas in our head that we sometimes don’t really want to
 listen to others.  We need to decide if we are going to listen to others with ‘jackal
 ears’ or with ‘giraffe ears.’ These are terms invented by Kelly Bryson to describe
 two kinds of listening.  Jackal ears mean that we are listening to the other person
 while still stuck in our own bad feelings or stiff ideas.  We hear what the other
 person says but we don’t trust what we are hearing, or we doubt that the other
 person is being honest.  Instead of listening quietly we might interrupt and say
 something like, “I don’t believe you,” or, even worse, “You are still a jerk for
 what you did.”  If we are wearing giraffe ears we are trying to listen to the other
 person with compassion and with the hope that we can better understand them so
 we can resolve some of the bad feelings between us.</p>
<p>Break into groups of two and create very short skits that show the differ
ence between jackal and giraffe ears.  Have fun with your skits and be creative.
 This will help you to learn and remember the concepts in this lesson.</p>
<p> *Giraffe and jackal ears are described in Kelly Bryson’s book, Don’t Be Nice, Be Real.
 More about that and his other books can be found on his web-site, www.languageofcom
passion.com.</p>
<p> Lesson #6 — A world of feelings</p>
<p>Every day we have new feelings and everybody else is also carrying differ
ent feelings around inside them.  We all act according to what we are feeling
 inside.  The more we understand how feelings work, the more we can be supportive and responsive to other people. We cannot only be more successful ourselves,
 but we will be in a position to help others. When we experience negative feelings,
 they usually bring along concepts and attitudes of separateness and difference – of
 less and more, of me and them, or of superiority and inferiority.  When we experi
ence positive feelings, they usually bring along concepts and attitudes of balance,
 connection with others and oneness. So the more we can be aware of our negative
 feelings and accept them, the more we can balance them, channel them, and speak
 them. At the same time, the more we can be aware of our positive feelings,
 embrace them, and celebrate them, the happier we will be and the more we can
 help others. </p>
<p>Choose your favorite positive feeling and express that feeling in writing,
 song, art, drama, storytelling or movement.   Share your creative expression with
 the class if you wish.</p>
 <p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
 <p> a) Talk about the first chapter quotation. Why do you think Ralph Waldo Emerson
 says, “love is our highest word”?</p>
 <p> b) What about hate? It is such a powerful negative emotion.  How do you think
 people get to a place where they start to hate?  What causes people to hate?</p>
 <p> c) Look at quotation #2.  What are the two most important elements of friendship
 according to Emerson?  Discuss what these two things mean. Give examples. Do
 you try to practice these two things with your friends?</p>
 <p> d) Read quotation #3.  Make a chart showing the connection between understand
ing, love, and peace that Deepak Chopra is talking about.  Talk about what this
 connection means and how we can practice it. </p>
 <p class="side">Supplemental Activities:</p>
 <ul>
    <li> <p>Feelings can be thought of in different combinations, not just in pairs of oppo
sites.  Below is an affirmation (see Chapter 8) that some people find useful.  Read
 the affirmation below by yourself or together with your class.  Then discuss what
 it means. </p>
 <p>I am light – there is no darkness.</p>
<p> I am love – there is no fear.</p>
<p> I am one – there is no separateness. –Indian scriptures</p></li>
 <li> <p>Break into small groups and do a cooperative creative expression of different
 feelings.  You can use art, music, drama, movement, writing, or storytelling.
Include both positive and negative feelings and try to use as many as possible in
 your creation.</p></li>
 <li><p>Using a harmony table and a harmony flower: Set aside a special table in your
 classroom where two people can meet when they want to share feelings with each
 other.  You can call it the ‘harmony table’ or you can give it another name.  At the
 harmony table you can keep a plastic rose or another kind of flower, which you
 can call the ‘harmony flower.’ The person who is sharing their feelings holds the
 harmony flower while the other person is listening. Then the harmony flower is
 given to the other person so that he or she can share.  Only the person holding the
 harmony flower should talk.  Using the harmony table and the harmony flower,
 you can practice sharing your feelings and listening to your classmates’ feelings.</p></li>
