<p class="side">Chapter Story:</p>
<p> Earnest H. Shackleton (1874-1922) was born in County Kildare, Ireland.
 Shackleton became very well-known for his Nimrod Expedition to Antarctica
 from 1907-1909. Then in 1913 he announced plans for a new expedition to do
 something nobody had ever done: To reach the South Pole and to cross Antarctica
 from one end to the other.  His expedition would be called the Endurance 
named after the ship he would sail on.  His expedition would require lots of coop
eration among the teammates, but nobody knew how the expedition would turn
 out!
 
</p>
<p> People across Britain became very excited about their journey.  Wealthy
 citizens donated money to make the expedition possible.  Public schools in Great
 Britain contributed money to pay for dog teams, and each dog team was named
 after a school that had donated funds. More than five thousand sailors, scientists,
 and adventurers applied to go on the expedition.  Out of these five thousand,
 Shackleton chose fifty-six men with different talents and skills that he felt were
 the most qualified to accomplish his mission.  Twenty-eight of the men sailed
 with Shackleton on the ship Endurance along with several sled dogs. The other
 twenty-eight men would sail on a different ship. 
</p>
<p>Shackleton’s expedition began on August 1, 1914, when the Endurance set
 sail from England.  After making the long journey around Cape Horn in Africa
 and arriving closer to the Antarctic, the weather started to become colder and the
 ship had trouble making it through the ice in the water. The ice grew thicker and
 thicker and some days the ship could not move at all.
</p>
<p> On January 19th the ship Endurance became solidly frozen in ice. It could
 not move.  Shackleton and his crew had no choice but to stay there stuck in the
 ice for the winter. They were hoping that when the spring came and the ice melt
ed, they would be able to get the ship out.  The crew passed lots of time singing
 songs and by having the first ever dog sled races, and by cleaning their ship,
 which they called ‘the Ritz’, as if it were a hotel.  The crew played their final
 football and hockey games on the ice.</p>
<p>The sun disappeared as the seventy-day Antarctic winter night began.  The
 temperature fell to –23F at midnight on July 11.  Around that time there was a
 severe blizzard. The winds blew at the rate of 70 miles an hour. The snow piled
 five feet deep – 100 tons of snow piled up on the sides of the ship. Shackleton
 was very concerned about pressure from the ice on the sides of the ship. By
 August they were running out of food for the dogs. Seals and penguins had disap
peared. It had even become too cold for them!  By Sunday, October 23rd the ship
 could not take the severe pressure of the ice and it began to leak. Shackleton and
 his crew worked together feverishly to pump the water from the ship and to patch
 the leak. But on Wednesday, Oct. 26th, they had to abandon the ship because it
was crushed beyond repair. Shackleton and his crew were very sad about the ship
 but they had to focus on what to do next.   They took provisions and equipment
 and abandoned the ship.  </p>
<p>At that time Shackleton and his crew were 346 miles from Paulet Island.
 That was the nearest place where there was any food or shelter. Shackleton knew
 that at Paulet Island there was a shelter, with extra food left by a previous expedi
tion. Somehow he had to get to Paulet Island, but how?</p>
<p> Shackleton thought about his dangerous situation.  The only solution was
 to drift between the icebergs in the smaller boats that were attached to the sides of
 their ship, Endurance.  They took the boats off the Endurance and no sooner than
 they did, their beloved ship began to sink beneath the ice!  Endurance had been
 locked in ice for 281 days and now she was gone forever.  It was November 21,
 1915, and it was a very sad day for Shackleton and his crew.  Nevertheless they
 had to move on.</p>
<p>Shackleton and his crew departed in two small sailboats. With their gear,
 food and sledges, there was barely room to sit comfortably, let alone sleep.
 Shackleton and his crew stopped to rest and camped on different ice flows
 (chunks of ice), but each time the ice flows started breaking up beneath them. It
 was not safe, so they had to keep drifting and just sleep on the boats.  The night
time on the boats was the scariest thing of all.  The boats were very small and the
 waves sometimes were very big and splashed over the sides of the boat.  It was
 very hard to sleep since they were not sure if the sea would tip them over at any
 moment.  Yet somehow they made it to land – but not to the place they thought
 they were going to. On April 12th, the two small boats drifted to a place called
 Elephant Island.  They found a spit of land where they could safely land.  This
 was not Paulet Island, where they were trying to go, but at least they were on
 land.  Shackleton and his crew were so happy! This was their first time on land in
 16 months, if you count all the time they were at sea and then stuck on their
 frozen ship!</p>
<p> Even though they were happy to be on land, Shackleton and his crew cer
tainly didn’t want to spend the rest of their lives on Elephant Island. There were
 no human beings there besides them! They had to find a way to make it to some
place where there was civilization - where they could be safe and where they
 could ask for help to make it back to England. The only solution Shackleton
 could think of was to make a dangerous, 800 mile, voyage to a whaling station at
 a place called South Georgia. However, in order to get there, they would have to
 cross the ocean south of Cape Horn, Africa, which at that time of year was known
 to be the stormiest area of water in the world. The voyage would take about a
 month.</p>
<p>Shackleton began the voyage along with five members of his crew, named
 Worsley, Crean, McNeish, McCarthy and Vincent. The rest of the crew, Shackle
ton left behind on Elephant Island. Shackleton appointed a man named Wild to be
 Captain in charge, because he thought that Wild was the strongest and bravest.
 Wild’s team on Elephant Island faced many challenges.  Food came to be in short
 supply. They made stew of seal bones and seaweed.  They had to share the tiny
 amount of food they had. One day, a man named Blackborrow fell into the icy
 water and he developed severe frostbite on his feet. Captain Wild instructed two
 of his crew to amputate Blackborrow’s feet.  As hard as this was to do, they had
 to do it because Blackborrow would die from gangrene if they didn’t.  In the end
 they saved Blackborrow’s life in this way.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, a man named Hussey would play banjo at night while the men
 would sing.  This would cheer everybody up, because they had to face so many
 challenges each day just to stay alive. After many days and weeks of waiting,
 some of the men began to lose hope that Shackleton would ever return to rescue
 them.  Commander Wild told them not to lose hope and that if they helped each
 other and supported each other they would survive and be rescued.</p>
<p> Meanwhile, on Shackleton’s journey around Cape Horn, it seemed like
 their small boat would capsize a thousand times, but it never did.  They passed
 icebergs of all different shapes. Sometimes, because the men were so tired and
 hungry, they imagined that the icebergs were alive!  It was quite scary when this
 happened.  One day there was a huge snowstorm and the boat became covered in
 heavy ice.  The boat looked more like a log than a boat.  The men had to work
 together to chip the ice away from the boat. They had to throw many things over
board to lessen the weight and they had to break away from their anchor to try to
 get away.  It was dangerous to cut away the anchor but they had no choice.  They
 chipped ice from the sails and hoisted them up, and luckily the sails worked! The
 boat was able to move again. They were on their way, but frostbite became a seri
ous problem because they had gotten so wet. They all developed frostbite blisters
 that were very painful.</p>
<p> After seven days, the wind finally subsided and the sun came out. They
 dried their clothes in the sun. The ice on the boat and around the boat began to
 melt and porpoises came blowing along the boat. To feel the sun and to see the
 porpoises was one of the happiest experiences for Shackleton and his crew.  But
 they still had not reached their destination and they had to face one more storm,
 which surprised them suddenly. It was a major blizzard with enormous waves.
 Shackleton told his men to hold on and help each other stay aboard the boat and
 not fall into the deadly, icy waves.  He told them to not get too afraid and to work
 together to bale the water out of the boat. Because they cooperated completely,
 they survived the storm.  In two more days they made it to their destination 
South Georgia. They had crossed the most dangerous part of the sea in the world
 in a small sailboat in just 14 days.
</p>
<p>They were still 17 miles from the whaling station on South Georgia. They
 would still have to cross over mountains and glaciers. It seemed almost impossi
ble since they were so tired from their journey and from lack of good food.
 McNeish and Vincent were too weak to go on. Shackleton, Crean and Worsley set
 out to cross the mountains to the whaling station.  It was a difficult journey.
 Shackleton’s companions were so tired during the night, they wanted to just lie
 down on the snow and sleep.</p>
<p> Shackleton would not let them sleep because they were so tired and wet
 that they would not have been able to get up again and they would have died on
 the ice.  They finally heard the sweet sound of the steam whistle at the whaling
 station. This made them very excited and they rushed down the side of the moun
tain. They were almost there, but on the way Shackleton fell through the ice and
 had to be pulled out of the water by the others.  The whaling station finally came
 into sight and they congratulated themselves on their heroic journey. The guard at
 the whaling station was scared at first, when he saw them, because they looked so
 dirty and wild, having traveled so long in such bad conditions.
</p>
<p> Shackleton and his companions got a bath, some good food, and lots of
 rest at the whaling station.  The next and final goals were to retrieve McNeish and
 Vincent from the other side of the mountains and then to sail to Elephant Island to
 rescue Captain Wild and the other half of his original crew. It took Shackleton
 four attempts with four different boats to go back and rescue the men on Elephant
 Island.  Each time something went wrong, but he didn’t give up. He knew he had
 to rescue Captain Wild and the others.  The men on Elephant Island under the
 leadership of Wild had survived and waited 105 days to be rescued. During that
 time they had no news from the outside world or any way of contacting Shackle
ton.  Yet they all had faith that Shackleton would return. The men on Elephant
 Island never saw a happier sight than when they saw Shackleton’s ship approach
ing Elephant Island.  As the ship approached the island, Captain Wild directed the
 men on the island to carry Blackborrow to a hillside so he could see all the activi
ty (since he had lost his feet and could not walk).  </p>
<p>When the ship got close enough, Shackleton yelled to Wild on the shore:
 “Are you all well?”  And the boss of the island, Wild, shouted back, “All safe, all
 well, thank God!”  Somehow, every one of Shackleton’s 26-member crew had
 survived – those who were on the boat with him and those who stayed on Ele
phant Island with Captain Wild.  They were able to make it because of their
 courage, their ingenuity, and their amazing trust in one another.  Shackleton and
 his crew returned to England in May, 1917.  He did not accomplish his original
 mission but he had successfully completed one of the greatest adventures ever!
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview: 
</p>
<p>In the world we live in there is a lot of focus on competition and winning.
 We celebrate champions and people like to be Number One.  Sometimes we for
get that not everyone can be Number One.  Sometimes, if we lose a game, we
 might feel sad because we didn’t win.  In the worst case, the other team might
 make fun of us because we didn’t win.  Competition can challenge us to do well,
 but it can also result in hurt feelings.</p>
<p> When we are focused on competition we often have the feeling that it is
 ‘me against you’ or ‘us against them’.  This kind of attitude happens when we are
 playing on the playground when we are trying to win the game and defeat the
 other team.  We can also see this attitude when we are doing our schoolwork,
 when we are trying to get a better grade than someone else.  This attitude is very
 common and we see it all the time.  However, just because it is common does not
 mean it is completely good.  It is also very important to know that we can make a
 choice about whether we want to be in a competitive mind or not.
</p>
<p> There is another way to be – another way to work and play together.  It is
 called cooperation.  Cooperation means working together as a team for a common
 goal. When we are stuck in competition we often use the words ‘I’, ‘me’ or ‘my
 team’.  On the other hand, when we practice cooperation we use the words ‘we’,
 ‘us’ and ‘ours’.  In competition, the focus is on what is best for me.  In coopera
tion, the emphasis is on what is good for us – the whole group.  In competition,
 very often somebody can get left out or left behind. There is a special advantage
 to cooperation and that is that nobody gets left out or left behind.  Cooperation
 involves everyone and is good for everyone.
</p>
<p>We can practice cooperation in many different ways.  We can learn coop
erative games to play where everyone can win and everyone can have fun.  We
 can learn how to cooperate and help each other with our schoolwork.  Each of us
 has subjects we are strong in and other subjects we are not as strong in.  We can
 work together so that those of us who are strong in math can help those who are
 not as strong, and those who are strong in reading and writing can help those who
 are not as strong.  In this way, everyone at school can be successful. Everyone at
 school can be both a teacher and a learner. We can also practice cooperation in
 building a harmonious community, by setting goals we all want to achieve and
 then by supporting and encouraging each other as we try to meet those goals.
</p>
<p>All of these kinds of kinds of cooperation will help to prepare us for the
 most important cooperation challenge of all – that is the challenge of helping peo
ple across the whole world learn how to cooperate.  Learning how to cooperate
 means seeing things in a different way. Instead of looking at what is good just for
 me, we learn to look at might be good for everybody. This takes lots and lots of
 practice.  Yet if we start practicing now at home, on the playground, and in our
classroom, then one day we will become experts in cooperation. We will be able
 to become teachers of cooperation if we want to. We will be able to be leaders
 and show others that cooperation is a better way for everyone.</p>
<p> Chapter Lessons:
</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 - Building a cooperative community</p>
<p> a) Setting a Class or Family Meeting
</p>
<p> We are all gathered here to make a plan to create a more harmonious,
 happy, and fulfilling classroom or home environment.  We want to give everyone
 a chance to give his or her ideas for helping make the system work.  We will have
 regular meetings where we can talk about the community we are building, to
 learn new ways of cooperating and to practice our cooperation skills.</p>
 <p>b) Creating Our Goals </p>
 <p>To build a cooperative community we need to make some decisions as a
 family or as a classroom as to what our specific goals are. It is best to do this with
 the participation of everyone. This is your community and whatever guidelines
 we agree upon must be important and meaningful to you.  It is also helpful to
 keep your list of goals short and simple.  Here is a sample list of goals:</p>
 <p> Peace- striving to create peace within oneself as well as in the home or classroom</p>
 <p>Excellence - doing one's very best in academics, arts, athletics, and in the class
 community or family community </p>
 <p>Transcendence - achieving something that one has never achieved before; meeting
 a goal that was set; beating a previous score or attaining a new level, etc.</p>
 <p> c) Acknowledgements</p>
 <p>Each time we gather for our meetings we will practice something called
 ‘acknowledgements’. Acknowledgements means showing our appreciation for
 each other.  When we practice acknowledgements, we tell about a special thing
 that someone has done or about a special quality, talent or skill that they have.
 Today we’ll begin to practice acknowledgements. Think of something special
 someone has done or accomplished this week. Then raise your hand and share
 what it is with the group.  It is important to try to acknowledge everyone in your
 class, not just your friends. You can also acknowledge your teachers, and your
 teachers can acknowledge you!</p>
 <p>d) Achievements and Actions that Deserve Acknowledgements
 Brainstorming a list of achievements or actions that deserve to be acknowl
edged can be helpful in giving us a good idea of what kinds of things we can
 acknowledge people for. Here is a sample list of achievements and actions you
 might want to acknowledge. They are listed under the headings of the sample
 goals we learned earlier.</p>
 <p> Sample Excellence Achievements:</p>
 <ul>

  <li><p>Reading a biography of a peace maker from history</p></li>
  <li><p>Helping a younger brother or sister</p></li>
  <li><p>Helping a younger student</p></li>
</ul>
<p> Sample Self-Transcendence Achievements:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Working harder on a project than you ever have</p></li>
  <li><p>Getting a better score than you have in the past</p></li>
  <li><p>Running a certain distance faster than ever before</p></li>

  <li><p>Displaying more tidiness than ever before</p></li>
  <li><p>Showing more self-discipline than usual</p></li>
  <li><p>Showing more tolerance about someone or something</p></li>
  <li><p>Exhibiting patience</p></li>
  <li><p>Being true to yourself</p></li>
  <li><p>Being flexible in a challenging situation</p></li>
  <li><p>Showing generosity towards someone</p></li>
  <li><p>Displaying self-control</p></li>
  <li><p>Showing moderation in an unhealthy habit</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can also refer to a list to learn of new ways we can contribute to the
 community.  We can try to do different kinds of achievements and actions instead
 of just starring in one or two of the same areas all the time. The most important
 thing to remember is that all of your efforts and achievements are part of our
 cooperation as a community. Every positive achievement or effort we make builds
 a more special and harmonious community for all of us!</p>
 <p> e) Acknowledgements - ‘Harmony Tokens’ and the ‘Harmony Bank’</p>
 <p> Today we are going to add a new activity to make acknowledgements even
 more fun and to help us to see how much we are working together.  We are going
 to create ‘harmony tokens’ and a ‘harmony token bank’.  Our harmony tokens can
 be polished stones, seashells, polished glass pieces, marbles, colored ping-pong
 balls or something else that you want to create.  (Colored ping-pong balls are fun
 because everyone gets to color them with markers.)  We have to decide as a class
 what we want to use as harmony tokens. We also need to create a harmony token
 bank – some place to collect all the harmony tokens we collect.   Then, each time
 someone gets acknowledged they will put a harmony token into the bank. We will
 watch our bank fill up more and more each day with the harmony tokens that
 everyone earns. We will be able to see all of the good things we are doing and we
 will be cooperating to fill the bank to the top!</p>
 <p> f) Acknowledgements – Celebration</p>
<p> When we fill up our harmony token bank we can celebrate together.  In
 other words, if our class earns enough harmony tokens, a special activity might
 take place - we might have some extra recess or free time, a special pizza lunch, a
 board game time, extra computer privileges, or a story time, an educational or
 uplifting video, or some other privilege. We could also ‘save up’ our harmony
 tokens, and fill up several banks’ worth of tokens to earn a special field trip or
 some such larger privilege.  The only guideline for our privileges is that they
 should be for all of our class to enjoy; all earned special activities or privileges
 should be group activities – things that we do all together.  We may also want to
 create or invent a special ceremony to do when we fill up our harmony token
 bank.  Our ceremony can include a song, a dance, a poem, or some other special
 activities.</p>
 <p> g) Acknowledgements </p>
 <p>Extension One</p>
 <p> We will have a special day where we get to acknowledge ourselves for
 something we are good at, something we have done well, or something we are
 proud of.  This will be a day for us to give ourselves credit for some things that
 others may not be aware of or may have overlooked.  It is OK to acknowledge
 ourselves sometimes! </p>
 <p>Extension Two</p>
 <p> Today we will practice a special kind of acknowledgement. We will
 acknowledge ourselves for trying something and making a mistake.  Mistakes are
 very important – they are the main reason we learn! It is healthy to acknowledge
 our mistakes once in a while and to share what we have learned from our mistake.
 Even the teacher can share a mistake he made.  It is so important for the students
 to hear that their teacher has made a mistake.  Note: Nobody has to do this activi
ty if they don’t feel comfortable with it.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2 - Beach ball teamwork</p>
<p>We will divide participants into three groups.  Each group will sit on the
 ground in a circle with their shoulders touching one another while facing outward.
 All three groups should form a straight line with about fifteen feet separating each
 group. About ten feet from the last group, place a container, such as a bucket.</p>
 <p>To begin the game, place an inflated beach ball along the backs of the first
 group. Everyone in Group One must make contact with the ball without touching
 it with their hands or feet, and they must transfer the ball to the second group
 without dropping it. Then Group Two will do the same by transferring the ball to
 Group Three who will then deposit the ball in the bucket. This is a timed event.
 We will go through at least three rounds. Each round we want the groups to
 improve the quality of their teamwork and the time of their solutions. The game
 ends when the groups are satisfied that the game can’t be done more quickly.</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson #3 - Blind trust walk</p>
 <p> Version One:</p>
 <p>We are going to walk to a spot across an empty field, across the play
ground, or across the classroom to see the spot where you will need to go. Then
 we are going to put on blindfolds and you will try to go to that spot with your
 blindfold on. We will choose certain people to be ‘spotters’.   It will be the job of
 the spotters to ensure the safety of the participants who are blindfolded.</p>
 <p>Version Two:</p>
 <p> I am going to show you a route that you will be traveling while blindfold
ed. After you get started and after a couple of minutes of observation, stop the
 group and appoint a leader who will not be blindfolded.  It will be the leader’s job
 to get the group safely to the appointed spot, but he/she will only be able to give
 them three separate sets of directions. If the group starts going off course, the
 leader can only stop them three times. It will be the leader’s job to ensure the
 safety of the participants.</p>
 <p class="side">Lesson #4 - Hula hoop circle</p>
 <p> Level One: </p>
 <p>All participants will stand in a circle and hold hands. Break the circle and
 place a hula-hoop on one side of the circle, then rejoin the hands together. The
 hula-hoop must travel around the circle, and end where it started. Connection
 must be maintained as if an electrical current were running through the group.
 Your hands cannot come apart at any time.  The event will be timed and repeated
 at least twice. The job of your group will be to cut your previous time down with
 each go round.</p>
 <p> Level Two:</p>
 <p>We will now add a hula-hoop on the opposite side of the first one! The
 instructions are that the hula hoops must travel around the circle in opposite
 directions and end where they started. Connection must be maintained as if an
 electrical current were running through the group. Your hands cannot come apart
 at any time. The event will be timed and repeated at least twice.  Your goal will
 be to cut your previous time down with each go round.</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson #5 - Animal game</p>
 <p> Level One:  </p>
 <p>We are going to divide our group into teams of 3-5 people. Each group will
 come up with a barnyard animal that they will pretend to be. Once your group
 decides on which animal you want to be, you cannot talk from this point forward.
 Each person will put on a blindfold Make sure you put the blindfolds over your
 eyes so you can’t see. It’s no fun if you cheat or try to speak!   First we will move
 each person to a different spot in the room. Now, when we begin the game, you
 are going to try to find the group you belong to by making the noise of your
 group’s animal. After you’ve found your group, keep making the noise of your
 animal so everyone else in your group can find their proper group. When the
 game is done you will be able to take your blindfolds off.</p>
 <p> Level Two: </p>
 <p>In Level Two, we will whisper a secret number into each person’s ear.
 This time, after you find your group you will have an additional task: You must
 communicate your secret number to the rest of the group without talking. You
 will have to be creative and use your animal language.  You will also have to lis
ten carefully to hear the other secret numbers!  The teacher will let you know
 when the game is finished.</p>
 <p class="side">Lesson #6 - The shoe game</p>
 <p> Level One:  </p>
 <p>In this game we are all going to remove our shoes and put them into a big
 pile in the middle of the room.  We will mix up all of the shoes so they are all in a
 jumble. All of the participants will sit in a circle surrounding the shoes.  When the
 teacher gives a signal we will all try to find our shoes, put the shoes on the right
 feet, and tie the laces, and then sit down silently in the circle again.  We will time
 the activity to see how long it takes us.  We will try to do the activity as quickly
 as we can, so it will be important that we try to help each other. It will also be
 helpful if we don't become too loud and crazy because that will make it more dif
ficult for us to communicate and to cooperate and our time will not be as good.
 Once we do this activity, we will do it one more time to see if we can improve
 our group time. We can keep track of our times so that in the future we can try
 again to improve our time.</p>
 <p> Level Two: </p>
 <p>In Level Two the game is the same as in Level One, except that we will
 give blindfolds to all of the participants. We will tell them to put the blindfolds
 on, covering their eyes so that they can’t see. We will shuffle the shoes as we did
 in Level One and then we will tell the participants to find their own shoes and put
 them on. The game is over when each participant is wearing his/her own shoes 
on the correct feet and tied properly – and sitting silently back on the circle.  For
 this level you may want to have one or two un-blindfolded ‘spotters’ to help
 everyone find their shoes!  We will also keep track of our time in Level Two as
 we did for Level One. When we do Level Two, we will not compare our Level
 Two times with Level One times because Level Two is much harder!  After we
 play the game once at Level Two, we will repeat it in the same way we did for
 Level One, to see if we can improve our score.</p>
 <p class="side"> Discussion Questions:</p>
 <p> a) Here is a quotation from Shackleton’s journal, towards the end of the
 Endurance Expedition: “We had suffered, starved and triumphed, groveled down
 yet grasped at glory, grown bigger in the bigness of the whole. We had seen God
 in His splendors, heard the text that nature renders.  We had reached the naked
 soul of man.”  Discuss this quotation, focusing on the meaning of some of the
 vocabulary, the poetic imagery, and the deeper meaning of the passage.</p>
 <p>b) “This is a world of independence and interdependence.”  Discuss this quotation
 from Margaret Wheatley.  Why is it important that we have both independence
 and interdependence for the world to progress?  You might want to start by defin
ing ‘independence’ and ‘interdependence’.</p>
<p> c)  “Individual commitment to a group effort – that is what makes a team work, a
 company work, a society work, a civilization work.”  This quotation by Vince
 Lombardi is very interesting because he is pointing out the fact that cooperation is
 needed to succeed in every kind of group – from a team to a company to a society
 to a civilization.  Discuss the kinds of cooperation that need to exist at all these
 different levels in order for the group to succeed.  Also, define what Vince Lom
bardi might mean by: “Individual commitment to a group effort.”</p>
<p> d) “Let it be our choice to make a world where everyone helps each other.” This
 quotation by Sri Chinmoy implies that we have a choice about whether to make
 the world better or not.  We have a choice about whether we want to learn and
 practice cooperation.  If you have begun to practice some of the lessons and skills
 in this book and in this chapter, then you have made the choice to try and improve
 the world.  In what other ways can we choose to change the world?  What is the
 best way to inspire others to make the choice to cooperate?</p>
 <p class="side"> Supplemental Activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make a map of Shackleton’s Expedition. Show his voyage, from where he started in Britain all the way to Antarctica. Then show where the Endurance got stuck and sank beneath the ice. After that you can show his journey to Elephant Island and to the whaling station in South Georgia. Finally you can show how he went back to Elephant Island to rescue Captain Wild and the others and then how they made their journey back to England. Note: You can make one big map or you might want to make two maps instead of one. The first map can be a map of Europe and Africa showing the big picture of the journey. The second map can show the details of all the adventures and challenges near Antarctica, including Elephant Island and South Georgia.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Make a timeline of Shackelton’s Expedition. A timeline is a list of the important dates of the expedition. Next to the date you can write a brief description of what happened on that date. Creating a timeline is a great way to remember a story and a great tool to be able to tell the story to others.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Choose a quotation from the chapter quotations above. Write the quotation in your journal or on a piece of paper and then write your thoughts and reflections on the meaning of the quotation.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      During most of the latter part of Shackleton’s Expedition, when his crew was fighting for survival, the men had to work cooperatively to hunt animals for food for themselves and for their dogs. They had to share the food so that everyone – people and dogs – could stay as strong and healthy as possible. There were not so many kinds of animals to hunt. Do some research about Antarctica and the area of Elephant Island to see if you can guess what kind of animals Shackleton and his crew might have hunted for food. If you choose, you can read a longer version of Shackleton’s story in order to find out the answer that way. Note: You might even find a few clues in the story of Shackleton in this chapter – but not all the possible answers.
