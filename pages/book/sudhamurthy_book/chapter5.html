      <p>The Red Rice Granary</p>
    </h1>
    <img src="Screenshot 2025-02-09 004002.png" alt="image">
    <p>
      Every year, our country has to face natural disasters in some form. It may be
      an earthquake in Gujarat, floods in Orissa or a drought in Karnataka.In a poor
      country, these calamities create havoc.</p>

    <p>In the course of my work, I have found that after such calamities, many
      people like to donate money or materials to relief funds. We assume that most
      donations come from rich people, but that is not true. On the contrary, people
      from the middle class and lower middle class, help more. Rarely do rich
      people participate wholeheartedly.</p>

    <p>A few years back, I was invited to a reputed company in Bangalore to
      deliver a lecture on Corporate Social Responsibility. Giving a speech is easy.
      But I was not sure how many people in the audience would really understand
      the speech and change themselves.</p>

    <p>After my talk was over, I met many young girls and boys. It was an affluent
      company and the employees were well-off and well-dressed. They were all
      very emotional after the lecture.</p>

    <p>'Madam, we buy so many clothes every month. Can we donate our old
      clothes to those people who are affected by the earthquake? Can you co ordinate
      and send them?'</p>

    <p>Some of them offered other things.
      'We have grown-up children, we would like to give their old toys and some
      vessels.'</p>

    <p>I was very pleased at the reaction. It reminded me of the incident in
      Ramayana where during the construction of the bridge between India and
      Lanka, every squirrel helped Sri Rama by bringing a handful of sand.</p>

    <p>'Please send your bags to my office. I will see that they reach the right
      persons.'</p>

    <p>Within a week, my office was flooded with hundreds of bags. I was proud
      that my lecture had proven so effective.</p>

    <p>One Sunday, along with my assistants, I opened the bags. What we saw left
      us amazed and shocked. The bags were brimming over with all kinds of junk!
      Piles of high-heeled slippers (some of them without the pair), torn
      undergarments, unwashed shirts, transparent, cheap saris, toys which had
      neither shape nor colour, unusable bedsheets, aluminium vessels, broken
      cassettes were soon piled in front of us like a mountain. There were only a
      few good shirts, saris and usable materials.</p>

    <p> It was apparent that instead of sending the material to a garbage or the
      kabariwala, these people had transferred them to my office in the name of
      donation. The men and women I had met that day were bright, well travelled,
      well-off people. If educated people like them behaved like this, what would
      uneducated people do?</p>

    <p>But then I was reminded of an incident from my childhood. I was born and
      brought up in a village in Karnataka's Haveri District, called Shiggaon. My
      grandfather was a retired schoolteacher and my grandmother Krishtakka
      never went to school. Both of them hardly travelled and had never stepped out
      of Karnataka. Yet they were hardworking people, who did their work
      wholeheartedly without expecting anything from anybody in their life. Their
      photographs never appeared in any paper, nor did they go up on a stage to
      receive a prize for the work they did. They lived like flowers with fragrance
      in the forest, enchanting everyone around them, but hardly noticed by the
      outside world.</p>

    <p>In the village we had paddy fields and we used to store the paddy in
      granaries. There were two granaries. One was in the front and the other at the
      back of our house. The better quality rice which was white, was always stored
      in the front granary and the inferior quality, which was a little thick and red,
      was stored in the granary at the back.</p>

    <p>In those days, there was no communal divide in the village. People from
      different communities lived together in peace. Many would come to our
      house to ask for alms. There were Muslim fakirs, Hindu Dasaiahs who
      roamed the countryside singing devotional songs, Yellamma Jogathis who
      appeared holding the image of Goddess Yellamma over their heads, poor
      students and invalid people.</p>

    <p>We never had too much cash in the house and the only help my grandfather
      could give these people was in the form of rice. People who receive help do
      not talk too much. They would receive the rice, smile and raise their right
      hand to bless us. Irrespective of their religion, the blessing was always 'May
      God bless you.' My grandfather always looked happy after giving them alms.</p>

    <p>I was a little girl then and not too tall. Since the entrance to the front
      granary was low, it was difficult for grown-ups to enter. So I would be given a
      small bucket and sent inside. There I used to fill up the bucket with rice and
      give it to them. They would tell me how many measures they wanted.</p>

    <p>In the evening, my grandmother used to cook for everybody. That time she
      would send me to the granary at the back of the house where the red rice was
      stored. I would again fill up the bucket with as much rice as she wanted and
      get it for her to cook our dinner.</p>

    <p>This went on for many years. When I was a little older, I asked my
      grandparents a question that had been bothering me for long.</p>

    <p>'Why should we eat the red rice always at night when it is not so good, and
      give those poor people the better quality rice?'</p>

    <p>My grandmother Krishtakka smiled and told me something I will never
      forget in my life.</p>

    <p>'Child, whenever you want to give something to somebody, give the best in
      you, never the second best. That is what I have learned from life. God is not
      there in the temple, mosque or church. He is with the people. If you serve
      them with whatever you have, you have served God.'</p>

    <p>My grandfather answered my question in a different way.</p>

    <p>'Our ancestors have taught us in the Vedas that one should,</p>

    <p>Donate with kind words.</p>
    <p>Donate with happiness.</p>
    <p>Donate with sincerity.</p>
    <p>Donate only to the needy.</p>
    <p>Donate without expectation because it is not a gift. It is a duty.</p>
    <p>Donate with your wife's consent.</p>
    <p>Donate to other people without making your dependents helpless.</p>
    <p>Donate without caring for caste, creed and religion.</p>
    ,p>Donate so that the receiver prospers.'</p>

    <p>This lesson from my grandparents, told to me when I was just a little girl,
      has stayed with me ever since. If at all I am helping anyone today, it is
      because of the teachings by those simple souls. I did not learn them in any
      school or college.</p>
