      <p>  Some for You and Some for Me: Learning to Become
 Partners in Sharing the World’s Resources</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="side">Chapter Inspiration: </p>
<p>“If you knew what I know about the power of giving, you would not let a single
 meal pass without sharing it in some way.” –Buddha
</p>
<p> “Conservation is humanity caring for the future.”  –Nancy Newhall
</p>
<p> “We must learn not to disassociate the airy flower from the earthly root, for the
 flower that is cut off from its root fades, and its seeds are barren, whereas the
 root, secure in Mother Earth, can produce flower after flower and bring their fruit
 to maturity.”   –The Kabbalah
</p>
<p>“Today's world requires us to accept the oneness of humanity.” –The Dalai Lama</p>
<p> “Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons.  It is to grow in the open
 air and to eat and sleep with the earth.” –Walt Whitman, Song of the Open Road</p>
<p> "I see a world where the most highly valued work will have the consciousness of
 caring." –Riane Eisler
</p>
<p> “Thank God men cannot as yet fly and lay waste to the sky as well as the earth!”–Henry David Thore
</p>
<p> “When you offer something to anybody, do it with both hands wide open.” –Sri Chinmo
</p>
<p> “There is not a flower or bird in sight, only a small screen on which lines are
 moving, while the child sits almost motionless, pushing at the keyboard with one
 finger.  As a learning environment, it may be mentally rich, but it is perceptually
 extremely impoverished.  No smells or tastes, no wind or bird song, (unless the
 computer is programmed to produce electronic tweets), no connection with the
 soil, water, sunlight, warmth, the actual learning environment is almost autistic in
 quality, impoverished sensually, emotionally, and socially.”   –John Davy</p>
<p>“Look at the lilies of the field. They do not worry about how they will adorn
 themselves.  Yet Solomon in all his glory is not arrayed like one of these.”  –Jesus
 Christ
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Story:
</p>
<p> Riane Eisler was born in Vienna, Austria in the middle of the 20th century.
 At that time, Austria, and much of the rest of Europe, was controlled by the
 Nazis.  The Nazis were a political party from Germany led by Adolph Hitler.
 They believed that they were superior to other human beings and that they were
 destined to take over the whole world and install Hitler as the dictator of the
 world. The Nazis, for reasons nobody really knows, looked down on Jewish peo
ple even more than they looked down on other people.  In Austria, as in other
 countries, the Nazis captured the Jewish people and sent them to enormous pris
ons called concentration camps.  At the camps, they deliberately killed many
 Jews, while other Jews died in the camps from malnutrition and cruel treatment.
</p>
<p> So this is the world that Riane Eisler grew up in.  And because her family
 was Jewish they faced many terrifying and horrible things.  When Riane was very
 young, she watched her father get beaten up by the German police, who were
 called the Gestapo. The Gestapo were extremely mean, and after beating up
 Riane’s father they took him away. Riane had seen the Gestapo take other people
 away and they did not come back, so she didn’t know if she would ever see her
 father again.  Then Riane’s mother courageously went to talk to the Gestapo. She
 told them it was not right that they took her husband and she demanded that her
 husband be set free.  Miraculously, Riane’s father was set free and allowed to
 come home. Riane was amazed at her mother’s courage.  As soon as Riane’s
 father was safely home, they began to plan how to escape from Austria, as it was
 much too dangerous for Jewish people to remain there with the Nazis in power.</p>
<p>During this time, in her child’s mind, Riane tried to make sense of the
 Nazis and what they were doing. She began to ask questions like, ‘Why are peo
ple cruel?’ ‘Why do they hurt and kill one another?’ ‘If this is really, as we are
 often told, just human nature, why isn't everyone like that?’ ‘Why are some peo
ple caring and peaceful?’ ‘What pushes us in one direction or the other?’ ‘What
 can we do to affect all this?’ These questions stayed with Riane throughout her
 whole life.</p>
<p> All of this happened to Riane before she was six years old. At the age of
 six, Riane and her family managed to get out of Austria before the Nazis caught
 them again. Then they took a ship to Cuba.  They had to start a completely new
 life in a foreign land, but they were very lucky, because millions of other Jewish
 people never made it out of Austria and other countries such as Poland, Hungary
 and Czechoslovakia, that were overrun by the Nazis. At the age of 14, Riane
came to North America</p>
<p> Riane began her university studies at the University of California, where
 she eventually received a degree in sociology and law.  She worked for a time as
 a social scientist at the Rand Corporation, got married, and had two children.
 During these years, she never forgot the questions that she had asked herself dur
ing her childhood.  In order try to answer those questions, she did an enormous
 amount of reading in a wide range of subjects, from sociology, anthropology, his
tory, psychology, and systems science to archeology, mythology, literature, evolu
tionary studies, women’s studies, and the arts. She gained a vast amount of
 knowledge in these different fields, and yet she didn’t find the answers she was
 looking for.</p>
<p> Gradually though, like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle coming together, Riane
 began to see patterns – connections between different bits of information from all
 these different areas and from the whole span of human history. Finally, she had a
 great realization: Human beings have a choice between two main ways of organ
izing their beliefs, their government, and their relationships. She called one of
 these two ways the ‘partnership’ model and the other way the ‘dominator’ model.
 Riane began to feel she was answering the questions that she first had as a child
 growing up in Nazi Austria.</p>
<p>The partnership model was the way of peace and harmony, in which
 human beings cooperated together to build a society that would benefit everyone.
 The citizens followed laws because they wanted to and because they felt good
 about the society they were living in. Problems were generally solved in a peace
ful way. In the partnership model, women and men were equally important in the
 society.  Men and women treated each other with respect, and men and women
 generally had equal rights.</p>
<p>The dominator model was the way of power, where some people controlled
 other people in the society in such a way that not everyone was equal. People fol
lowed the laws because they were afraid of what might happen to them if they
 didn’t.  Problems were often solved with the use of violence.  In the dominator
 model, men and women did not have equally important roles in the society, men
 often did not respect women, and women did not have equal rights with men.</p>
<p> Riane discovered that she could look at all of human history according to
 these two models or human behavior. With this in mind, she began to find more
 and more clues in the different subjects she had studied and she went on to make
 many other important discoveries.  She began to write down and organize all
 these ideas. The first books she published were Dissolution, in 1977, and The
 Equal Rights Handbook, in 1978.  Then in 1987 she published a book called The
 Chalice and the Blade, which became an international best seller – it was translat
ed into more than 22 languages.  Riane went on to write several other books and
 over 200 articles.   Her ideas of the partnership model and the dominator model
became known around the world.  </p>
<p>Many people found Riane’s ideas to be very helpful in understanding
 humanity’s evolution on earth. Previously, many people believed that human
 beings were just aggressive by nature and that they had no choice but to use vio
lence sometimes. According to this way of thinking, war is inevitable which
 means it is just going to happen from time to time, because that’s the way human
 beings are by nature.  Riane believed this way of understanding human beings
 was false, and she tried to prove in her research and her writing that human
 beings could be very peaceful if they had the right opportunities.  In her work she
 has shown many examples of human beings developing partnership societies
 throughout history, right up to today.  She has proven that it is possible to build a
 peaceful society if you have the right tools.</p>
<p> In 1995, Riane published a study that showed a strong link between the
 status of women and the general quality of a nation’s life.  In this important work,
 Riane studied statistics and information from 89 countries.  Today, Riane contin
ues to study, to write and to give lectures around the world.  In recent years she
 has turned her attention to the importance of education, because she has come to
 believe that the tools of making a peaceful world must be taught when people are
 still young. Her book, Tomorrow’s Children, is about how children can be taught
 partnership skills.  
</p>
<p>Riane’s most recent book is called The Power of Partnership. Her goal in
 this book is to help us to recognize the partnership and dominator tendencies in
 our own relationships and friendships.  The book is intended to help us human
 beings understand ourselves, to help us forgive ourselves and each other when we
 make mistakes, and to help us be patient as we try to build a partnership world.
 Riane’s dream is a world in which all people are sharing all of the world’s
 resources and cooperating to build a future in which each citizen of the world has
 an equal stake.  She continues to work towards this goal every day.</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview:
</p>
<p>Our planet earth is a very fragile place.  Every living thing on the planet is
 important because it plays a role in the web of life.  If one kind of plant dies, it
 means that some particular kind of animal will be without its source of food.  The
 different kinds, or types, of plants or animals – for example, daisies or roses; or
 raccoons, elephants, or dogs – are called species.  If a particular animal species
 goes out of existence, then that will in turn affect the healthy existence of other
 animals. If this happens over and over, and plant and animal species continue to
 die out, as they are doing today, this causes a big problem.  Entire ecosystems 
the other plants and animals that depend in some way on the dying-out species 
are disturbed, and eventually the whole balance of life is upset.  Right now there
 are more than 1,000 endangered animal species worldwide!</p>
<p>As the population of human beings on earth continues to grow, so does our need
 for cattle grazing land and land for growing crops.  In order to feed the growing
 number of people we use more acres of land for crops, we use more water to irri
gate the land, and we use more chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides.  As
 farmland spreads, forests have to be cut down. Meanwhile we are taking more
 and more fish out of our oceans, to use them for food.  In some parts of the ocean
 it is difficult to find some of the species of fish that used to swim there in great
 schools.
</p>
<p> As we humans populate the planet, we are building more and more homes
 and other buildings.  We need more and more wood and that means we need to
 cut down more trees.  Hundreds of thousands of factories are spread across the
 globe to build our cars, clothes, appliances, furniture, toys and many other things.
 Manny of these factories pollute the environment with chemicals because there
 are very weak environmental laws in many countries. Meanwhile, with so many
 automobiles and factories producing toxic gases like carbon monoxide and other
 gases, the ozone layer of the earth’s atmosphere, which protects life on earth from
 harmful rays of the sun, is getting destroyed.
</p>
<p>The need that human beings on the planet have for energy increases every
 day.  We all get energy from the food we eat in order to keep our bodies alive.
 But we also need energy to power our cars, airplanes, boats, our televisions, com
puters, refrigerators, lights, and so many other things.  These all require energy
 and it takes fuel to produce that energy.  Much of the fuel we use – such as wood,
 oil, natural gas, or coal – is not renewable. That means that once we use it we
 cannot make more. Many of these kinds of fuels also create lots of pollution. </p>
<p>Even with all of this expansion and growth of farmland, building construc
tion, and energy production, many people on planet earth do not share in the ben
efits of these things.  Hundreds of millions of people on the planet live without
 running water or toilets. They have no electricity.  They cannot afford a car, a tel
evision, a computer, or even a telephone –things that most of us in the United
 States take very for granted.  The wealthier nations of the world, such as the Unit
ed States, use way more than our share of the world’s natural resources and ener
gy, and get most of the benefits in return.  Many nations allow their resources to
 be mined or taken, but the people of those nations do not get the same benefits as
 we in the U.S. do.
</p>
<p> With so many challenges facing us, what can we do?  How can we save
 the endangered species, protect our environment, conserve energy, and learn to
 share the world’s natural resources in a way that is fairer than the way things are
 doing now?
</p>
<p>The first thing we can do is to educate ourselves about some of these prob
lems.  We need to learn as much as possible about these global challenges, so we
 understand the sources of the problems. Then we can take action to do something
 positive about some issue or challenge that we are interested in. In this chapter we
 will learn more about these global issues that Riane Eissler cares so much about,
 and we will explore some different ways we can begin to take action to help. 
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson 1 - Making rainbow necklaces and bracelets
</p>
<p> For this activity you will need some waxed twine or string, some plastic
 colored beads with holes and some nimble fingers. You will need a variety of
 bead colors. See the bead colors and their meanings below. Note that the bead
 colors are different from the colors for the Web of Life Game in Chapter 11.  This
 is a different game, and it has somewhat different meanings for the colors. If you
 choose to, however, you can use the colors described in Chapter 11 for your bead
 necklaces and bracelets.</p>
<p>a) First, measure a piece of waxed string to see how much you will need to make
 a necklace or a bracelet.  Once you have measured, then add a few inches, and
 then cut your string from the spools. Note: If you are making a necklace, your
 string needs to be big enough to fit over your head – unless you are going to
 make a tighter-fitting necklace.  For a snugger-fitting necklace you will need to
 leave enough string on both ends to tie together when you are finished.
</p>
<p>b) Next tie one end of your string tightly onto a single bead – so the string cannot
 slip off.  It is best if you leave an inch or two of extra string on one side of the
 knot in case you need it. On the other side of the knot will be several more inches
 of string where you will do your stringing.  For a necklace you will need six to
 ten inches of string.  For bracelets you will only need three to five inches of
 string.</p>
 <p>c) Hold your string so that the knotted bead is on the bottom. Begin stringing
 your beads.  First you will put a colored bead, then a white bead, then another
 colored bead, and so on.  Alternate the colors, so you have each of the colors rep
resented. In other words, put one of each color on the string before you put two
 beads of any color.  Remember to put a white bead in between every colored
 bead.  The white beads are for the invisible bond of life that connects all living
 things, and they also symbolize the caring love of human beings for other living
 things.  The white beads are for the mystery of life and for our love for all living
things. The white beads remind us we share the whole earth with all living things</p>
<p> d) Once you have completed one ‘round’ of colors, keep adding beads until your
 string is full of beads.  It takes a little practice to know when to stop stringing and
 what length of string you will need. When you are done stringing you will need to
 tie the second end of your string to the same bead where you tied your first end.
 Make sure you tie a tight knot. Now you have completed your loop and your beads
 won’t fall off! Once you are sure your necklace is complete, you can trim off any
 extra string with scissors.  Congratulations, you have finished your bracelet or
 necklace!</p>
 <p>e) If you are trying to make a snug fitting necklace instead of one that just slips
 over your head, you do not tie the last end of the string to the knotted bead.  You
 will gently tie the two ends of your string together at the back of your neck. If you
 tie a gentle but secure knot you will be able to undo the waxed string when you
 want to take your snug rainbow necklace off.</p>
 <p> f) Whenever you wear your rainbow necklace or bracelet you can spend a few
 minutes touching each bead.  As you touch the bead you can say the color and
 what that color stands for. We will use the chart below to learn the meanings of the
 colors. If we do this activity once a day, it can be a reminder of our indivisible
 connection with all living things.</p>
 <p> g) Once you have made a bracelet or a necklace the original way described above,
 you can try to become more creative the next time around. For instance you can
 put two of every color along the whole string, or you can try variations.  Also,
 once you have become good at making rainbow bracelets and necklaces, you can
 help younger students to make one.  Remember to tell them the meanings of the
 colors. That’s the most important thing for them to learn!</p>
 <p> Bead Colors:</p>
 <p>Yellow is for the sun and the life-giving energy it brings to us.</p>
 <p>Dark blue is for the sea, for the lakes and rivers, and for all the waters of the earth.</p>
 <p>Light blue is for the sky, for the air that we breathe and for the atmosphere, which
 keeps our air from floating out into space, and also protects us from the rays of the
 sun that would harm us.</p>
 <p>Red is for all of the two-legged and four-legged animals and for human beings.
Green is for the plants on the earth, in the oceans, rivers, and lakes.  It is also for
 the oxygen they breathe out, which is the oxygen that we need to breathe in, in
 order to live.</p>
 <p>Lavender is for the insects that fly, that pollinate all of the flowering plants so
 they can reproduce and make fruits and vegetables for us to eat. It is also for the
 insects that crawl on and in the earth and fertilize the earth with nitrogen and
 other nutrients.</p>
 <p> Burgundy is for the birds that spread seeds across the earth.</p>
 <p>Purple is for the fish that swim in all of the waters. </p>
 <p>White is for the interdependence of all living things on the planet. We are all con
nected. White is also for the compassion and love of human beings, because
 humans have special responsibility to care for the animals, plants and each other.
 There should be a white bead in between every other bead to show the intercon
nectedness between all living things. </p>
 <p>Orange is for the birds that bring us colorful beauty and inspiration.  They help to
 spread seeds across the earth so that plants can spread from place to place.   They
 help us keep a diversity of plant life on earth.</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson #2 - Vivaldi nature exercise</p>
 <p>In this activity we will listen to the Four Seasons, a famous piece of music
 by Antonio Vivaldi. This piece of music has four movements – four different
 parts.  Each movement is about a different season. The whole piece of music goes
 from spring to summer to fall to winter. As we are listening we will draw with
 colored pencils, markers, or crayons.  We can draw images or designs or just col
ors. Whatever we are feeling from the music we can draw.   When the music is
 finished, we will have some extra time to finish our drawings.  Then we will
 invite students to share their drawings if they wish.  The Four Seasons reminds us
 of the beauty of nature. Nature is always there for us. The cycle of seasons never
 changes. It always goes in the same sequence – magically changing the summer’s
 green leaves to the wonderful colored leaves of fall.  Once the leaves fall, winter
 arrives bringing cold, frost, snow and new joys. Then in the spring it is like
 everything is reborn again.  Discuss how you felt when you listened to this musi
cal piece by Vivaldi.  Did any special images or visions come to you? What did
 you see in your mind’s eye?  Do you think Antonio Vivaldi is a good musical
 composer? Why?</p>
 <p class="side">Lesson 3 - The silent nature adventure</p>
 <p>For this lesson we will go on a special adventure in the forest or on our
 playground.  We will go on a walk and as we walk we will pay special attention
 to what we are experiencing though our senses.  For a period of time we will not
 talk at all.  The goal of our nature adventure is to experience nature without
 words.  After our silent nature adventure we will have a chance to draw and write
 about our experiences.  We will also share with each other about what we learned.</p>
 <p>a) With our ears we will pay attention to any insects or birds we might hear. If we are near a river or stream, we may hear running water. If we are lucky we may hear some animals such as the chirping of squirrels or chipmunks. We may also hear some sounds that are made by humans and not nature.</p>

<p>b) With our eyes we can observe things as big as the sky and as small as bugs eating a stump. We might observe a bird building its nest, caring for its young, or speeding through the trees. We might observe a butterfly or a honeybee going from flower to flower gathering nectar and pollinating the plants. We might observe many other things.</p>

<p>c) With our sense of smell we can smell the fragrance of the flowers, or of the earth after a rain, or of the skunk cabbage in a swamp. If we pay close attention we can also tell the difference between the smell of the deep forest compared with the smell near a stream or river, or compared with a meadow.</p>

<p>d) With our sense of touch we can feel a stone. We can feel the cool, soft water of a stream or the warm water of a pond. We can touch the grass. We can hug a tree and feel the bark around it. We can see how soft a dandelion can be and we can carefully feel how sharp is the thorn of a thistle or a rose. We can also feel the air on our faces or on our hands if we hold them outstretched to our sides as we walk.</p>

<p>e) With our sense of taste we might be able to taste some mint growing in a garden. Why not taste a blade of grass, or, better yet, a strand of hay growing in the field? If you gently munch down on the hay you can taste the sweet green juice inside. If there is a honeysuckle bush nearby, we can taste the sweet nectar that is inside by pulling very gently on the white stamen and licking the tiny bubble at the end before it falls off. Garden vegetables are always a wonder to taste if we have the chance. With wild plants in the forest, we should never taste anything without direct adult supervision and permission.</p>

 <p class="side">Lesson #4 - Endangered species</p>
 <p> Animals and plants become endangered across our planet due to the expan
sion of human population, the growth of cities and urban areas, the destruction of
 natural habitats like the rainforest or the everglades, and because of pollution.
 Here are some important facts about endangered species:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scientists have cataloged more than one and one-half million of the species that exist on earth today. Scientists estimate that 20 times that many species exist that have not been catalogued yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Up to 100 species become extinct every day. According to scientists, the total number of species lost each year may climb to 40,000 by the year 2100. This is a rate far faster than at any time on earth in the last 65 million years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Around the world, more than 3500 protected areas exist in the form of parks, wildlife refuges and other reserves. These areas cover a total of about 2 million square miles (5 million square km, or 3% of our total land area).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Today, more than 200 animal species in the United States are classified as endangered. More than 1,000 animal species are endangered worldwide.</p>

 <p>For this lesson we will make a list of all of the endangered species that we
 know of around the world. Then each student will make a picture and a fact card
 about one endangered species. As a class we will make a map showing in which
 countries the endangered species live.  We can make one map on a bulletin board
 or on the wall.  Each of us will add pictures and fact cards onto the map, on or
 near the country where that species lives.</p>
 <p class="side"> Lesson #5 - Recycling and conservation</p>
 <p>When we recycle items, we save valuable resources, cut down on energy
 use, and reduce pollution – which means a better planet for everyone.  When we
 conserve energy, it means that more energy might be made available to less fortu
nate people in the developing world. It also means that governments and busi
nesses can save money to put into research to create renewable forms of energy. </p>
 <p>There are many kinds of products we can recycle and many ways we can
 conserve energy.  One half of the class will make a list of all the different kinds of
 products that can be recycled.  The other half of the class will make a list of all
 the ways energy can be conserved.  The groups will elect a spokesperson or per
sons who will report back to the class and display their list.  Then as a class we
 will make a plan to do something to help with recycling and conservation at
 home, in the neighborhood, or at school.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #6 - Creating energy </p>
<p>We need energy to live. We get energy from food. But we also need energy
 to power all of our machines.  Right now, for many of the world’s machines, we
 are still using non-renewable kinds of fuel – such as petroleum, natural gas, and
 coal.  These fuels are often called ‘fossil fuels’. Once these things are used we
 cannot make more.  Also, petroleum and coal are very polluting kinds of fuel.
 There are other ways of generating energy which are renewable and which do not
 pollute – such as solar energy, geo-thermal energy, wind power, and waterpower.
 Do some research on one of these ways of making energy.  Then write down what
 is good about this kind of fuel or energy production and what some of its prob
lems or challenges are.  You can do this in a chart form if you wish:  Make a line
 down the middle of your page. In one column write the good things about the fuel
 or type of energy production. In the other column write what the problems or
 challenges are.  You can include a picture to illustrate this kind of fuel or energy
 production.  Once you are finished, we will invite people to share their informa
tion and their drawings with the class. </p>
<p class="side">Lessons # 7 and #8 - Organizations </p>
<p>Now let’s find out more about some of the organizations that try to
 improve the world situation by focusing on some of the challenges we mentioned
 in this chapter, such as the environment, endangered species, energy conservation,
 and recycling.  You will make a list of organizations that work on these global
 challenges.  Then you will choose one of the organizations on your list and find
 out more about it.  Do some research on the organization you are interested in.
 Write down some basic information about the organization.  Each student will
 give an oral report, if time allows.  We can also gather all of our mini-reports and
 make them into a book that we can copy, so that everyone has a complete collec
tion of information on these important organizations.  If time allows we will write
 to the organization that we researched and ask them to send us information about
 the work they do. </p>
<p>We will:</p>
<p>a) Write down the full name of the organization</p>

<p>b) When it was founded</p>

<p>c) The name of the person or group of people who founded the organization</p>

<p>d) Write down the mission of the organization</p>

<p>e) The main focus of the organization</p>

<p>f) Write down any other interesting or important information we find.</p>

<p>g) The reasons why this organization is good for the world</p>

<p>h) On a separate piece of paper, write a letter to the organization. Tell them what you think of their work. Then request that they send you some information on their work. Address an envelope to the organization, put a stamp on it and put it in the mail.</p>

<p>i) When materials from the organizations come in, we will gather all of the information in one place and sort it according to the various global issues we have studied. In this way we will have these things as a reference whenever we need to go back to them for important information.</p>

<p> Note: There are many other organizations that work on the problems of popula
tion, world hunger, health, medicine, water, and similar  issues.  We can add to
 the list and see how many organizations we can find.  Remember that a govern
mental agency, like the Environmental Protection Agency, is different from an
 independent or non-governmental  organization.  You might want to have a differ
ent list for these.</p>
<p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
<p> a) Walt Whitman said, “Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons.  It
 is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.” He believed it was
 very important for people to spend some time in nature in order to gain a deeper
 appreciation for life.  What is your favorite thing about nature?  What kinds of
 lessons have you learned from being in nature?</p>
<p> b) Henry David Thoreau lived in the 1800’s, before human beings built machines
 that could fly.  What do you think he meant when he said, “Thank God men can
not as yet fly and lay waste to the sky as well as the earth!”  Do you think Henry
 David Thoreau’s worry about how people would treat the air and the atmosphere
 might have turned out to be true?</p>
<p>c) Choose one of the quotations above that interests you.  Read the quotation to
 yourself.  Look up any words that you don’t know. Write the quotation in your
 journal.  Then write about the meaning of the quotation or write your thoughts
 about it.</p>
<p class="side">Supplemental Activities:</p>
<p> If you are interested in numbers and statistics, there are several websites where
 you can get more interesting and important numerical information about world
 challenges.  Choose one of them to investigate and report back to the class on
 what you discover. You should write down the important numbers and the facts
 that go with the numbers, which you want to remember</p>
<p>Look in the appendix under ‘Environmental Facts’ to see all of the information
 about the environment.  Find one to three facts that interest you and then share
 them with the class.
