      <p>MASTERS OF LONGEVITY</p>
    </h1>
    <h1 align=" center">
      <p>Words of wisdom from the
        longest-living people in the world</p>
    </h1>
    <p style="font-size: 10px">WHEN WE STARTED working on this book, we didn't want to just research the factors that
      contribute to a long and
      happy life; we wanted to hear from the true masters of this art.</p>
    <p>The interviews we conducted in Okinawa merit their own chapter, but in the
      section that precedes it we have provided an overview of the life philosophies of
      a few international champions of longevity. We're talking about
      supercentenarians—people who live to 110 years of age or more.
    </p>
    <p>The term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness
      Book of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it
      appeared in William Strauss and Neil Howe's Generations. Today there are an
      estimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only
      around 75 of them has been confirmed. They aren't superheroes, but we could see
      them as such for having spent far more time on this planet than the average life
      expectancy would predict.
    </p>
    <p>Given the rise in life expectancy around the world, the number of
      supercentenarians might also increase. A healthy and purposeful life could help
      us join their ranks.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at what a few of them have to say.</p>
    <h3>
      <p>Misao Okawa (117)</p>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">"Eat and sleep, and you'll live a long time. You have to learn to
      relax."</p>
    <p>According to the Gerontology Research Group, until April 2015, the oldest living
      person in the world was Misao Okawa, who passed away in a care facility in
      Osaka, Japan, after living for 117 years and 27 days</p>
    <p>The daughter of a textile merchant, she was born in 1898, when Spain lost its
      colonies in Cuba and the Philippines, and the United States annexed Hawaii and
      launched Pepsi-Cola. Until she was 110, this woman—who lived in three
      different centuries—cared for herself unassisted.</p>
    <p>When specialists asked about her self-care routine, Misao answered simply,
      "Eating sushi and sleeping," to which we should add, having a tremendous thirst
      for life. When they inquired about her secret for longevity, she answered with a
      smile, "I ask myself the same thing."

    </p>
    <p>Proof that Japan continues to be a factory of long life: In July of the same year
      Sakari Momoi passed away at 112 years and 150 days old. At the time he was the
      oldest man in the world, though he was younger than fifty-seven women.</p>
    <h3>
      <p>María Capovilla (116)</p>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">"I've never eaten meat in my life."</p>
    <p>Born in Ecuador in 1889, María Capovilla was recognized by Guinness as the
      world's oldest person. She died of pneumonia in 2006, at 116 years and 347 days
      old, leaving behind three children, twelve grandchildren, and twenty great-and
      great-great-grandchildren.</p>
    <p>She gave one of her last interviews at age 107, sharing her memories and her
      thoughts:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">I'm happy, and I give thanks to God, who keeps me going. I never thought I'd live so
      long, I thought I'd
      die long ago. My husband, Antonio Capovilla, was the captain of a ship. He passed away at 84. We had
      two daughters and a son, and now I have many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
      Things were better, back in the old days. People behaved better. We used to dance, but we were
      more restrained; there was this one song I loved dancing to: "María" by Luis Alarcón. I still remember
      most of the words. I also remember many prayers, and say them every day.
      I like the waltz, and can still dance it. I also still make crafts, I still do some of the things I did when
      I was in school.
    </p>
    <p>When she had finished recalling her past, she began to dance—one of her
      great passions—with an energy that made her seem decades younger.
      When asked about her secret for longevity, she responded simply, "I don't
      know what the secret to long life is. The only thing I do is I've never eaten meat in
      my life. I attribute it to that."
    </p>
    <h3>
      <p>Jeanne Calment (122)</p>
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">"Everything's fine."</p>
    <p>Born in Arles, France, in February 1875, Jeanne Calment lived until August 4,
      1997, making her, at 122, the oldest person of verified age in history. She
      jokingly said that she "competed with Methuselah," and there is no question that she broke numerous records as
      she went on celebrating birthdays.</p>
    <p>She died of natural causes at the end of a happy life during which she denied
      herself almost nothing. She rode a bicycle until she turned 100. She lived on her
      own until 110, when she agreed to move into a nursing home after accidentally
      starting a small fire in her apartment. She stopped smoking at 120, when her
      cataracts started making it hard for her to bring a cigarette to her lips.</p>
    <p>One of her secrets may have been her sense of humor. As she said on her
      120th birthday, "I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything's fine.</p>
    <h2>
      <p>Walter Breuning (114)</p>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">"If you keep your mind and body busy, you'll be around a long
      time."</p>
    <p>Born in Minnesota in 1896, Walter Breuning was able to see three centuries in his
      lifetime. He died in Montana in 2011, from natural causes; he'd had two wives
      and a fifty-year career on the railroad. At eighty-three he retired to an assisted
      living center in Montana, where he remained until his death. He is the secondoldest man (of verified age) ever
      born in the United States.</p>
    <p>He gave many interviews in his final years, insisting that his longevity
      stemmed from, among other things, his habit of eating only two meals per day
      and working for as many years as he could. "Your mind and your body. You keep
      both busy," he said on his 112th birthday, "you'll be here a long time." Back then,
      he was still exercising every day.</p>
    <p>Among Breuning's other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he
      wasn't afraid of dying. As he declared in a 2010 interview with the Associated
      Press, "We're all going to die. Some people are scared of dying. Never be afraid
      to die. Because you're born to die."</p>
    <p>Before passing away in 2011, he is said to have told a pastor that he'd made a
      deal with God: If he wasn't going to get better, it was time to go.</p>
    <h2>
      <p>Alexander Imich (111)</p>
    </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 19px">1)</p>
    <p>Born in Poland in 1903, Alexander Imich was a chemist and parapsychologist
      residing in the United States who, after the death of his predecessor in 2014, became the oldest man of
      authenticated age in the world. Imich himself died
      shortly thereafter, in June of that year, leaving behind a long life rich with
      experiences.</p>
    <p>Imich attributed his longevity to, among other things, never drinking alcohol.
      "It's not as though I'd won the Nobel Prize," he said upon being declared the
      world's oldest man. "I never thought I'd get to be so old." When asked about his
      secret to living so long, his answer was "I don't know. I just haven't died yet."
    </p>
    <h3>
      <p>Alexander Imich (111)</p>
    </h3>
    <p>The secret to long life, however, is not held by supercentenarians alone. There are
      many people of advanced age who, though they haven't made it into Guinness
      World Records, offer us inspiration and ideas for bringing energy and meaning to
      our lives.
    </p>
    <p>Artists, for example, who carry the torch of their ikigai instead of retiring,
      have this power.</p>
    <p>Art, in all its forms, is an ikigai that can bring happiness and purpose to our
      days. Enjoying or creating beauty is free, and something all human beings have
      access to.
    </p>
    <p>Hokusai, the Japanese artist who made woodblock prints in the ukiyo-e style
      and lived for 88 years, from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century,
      added this postscript to the first edition of his One Hundred Views of Mount
      Fuji:</p>
    <p style="font-size: 17px">All that I have produced before the age of 70 is not worth being counted. It is at the
      age of 73 that I
      have somewhat begun to understand the structure of true nature, of animals and grasses, and trees and
      birds, and fishes and insects; consequently at 80 years of age I shall have made still more progress; at
      90 I hope to have penetrated into the mystery of things; at 100 years of age I should have reached
      decidedly a marvelous degree, and when I shall be 110, all that I do, every point and every line, shall be
      instinct with life.</p>
    <p>In the pages that follow, we've collected some of the most inspirational words
      from artists interviewed by Camille Sweeney for the New York Times.
      7 Of those
      still living, none have retired, and all still enjoy their passion, which they plan to
      pursue until their final breath, demonstrating that when you have a clear purpose,
      no one can stop you.</p>
    <p>The actor Christopher Plummer, still working at eighty-six, reveals a dark
      desire shared by many who love the profession: "We want to drop dead onstage.
      That would be a nice theatrical way to go."
    </p>
    <p>Osamu Tezuka, the father of modern Japanese manga, shared this feeling.
      Before he died in 1989, his last words as he drew one final cartoon were "Please,
      just let me work!"</p>
    <p>The eighty-six-year-old filmmaker Frederick Wiseman declared on a stroll
      through Paris that he likes to work, which is why he does it with such intensity.
      "Everybody complains about their aches and pains and all that, but my friends are
      either dead or are still working," he said</p>
    <p>Carmen Herrera, a painter who just entered her one hundredth year, sold her
      first canvas at age eighty-nine. Today her work is in the permanent collections of
      the Tate Modern and the Museum of Modern Art. When asked how she viewed
      her future, she responded, "I am always waiting to finish the next thing. Absurd, I
      know. I go day by day."
    </p>
    <p class="highlight_section"><b>Never Stop Learning</b>
      "You may grow old and trembling in your anatomies, you may lie awake
      at night listening to the disorder of your veins, you may miss your only
      love, you may see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics, or know
      your honour trampled in the sewers of baser minds. There is only one
      thing for it then—to learn. Learn why the world wags and what wags it.
      That is the only thing which the mind can never exhaust, never alienate,
      never be tortured by, never fear or distrust, and never dream of
      regretting."
    <p class="highlight_section">—T. H. White, The Once and Future King</p>
    </p>
    <p>For his part, naturalist and author Edward O. Wilson asserted, "I feel I have
      enough experience to join those who are addressing big questions. About ten
      years ago, when I began reading and thinking more broadly about the questions of
      what are we, where did we come from and where are we going, I was astonished
      at how little this was being done."
    </p>
    <p>Ellsworth Kelly, an artist who passed away in 2015 at the age of ninety-two,
      assured us that the idea that we lose our faculties with age is, in part, a myth, because instead we develop a
      greater clarity and capacity for observation. "It's
      one thing about getting older, you see more. . . . Every day I'm continuing to see
      new things. That's why there are new paintings."</p>
    <p>At eighty-six, the architect Frank Gehry reminds us that some buildings can
      take seven years "from the time you're hired until you're finished,"
      14 a fact that
      favors a patient attitude with regard to the passage of time. The man responsible
      for the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, however, knows how to live in the here and
      now: "You stay in your time. You don't go backward. I think if you relate to the
      time you're in, you keep your eyes and ears open, read the paper, see what's going
      on, stay curious about everything, you will automatically be in your time."
    </p>
    <p class="highlight_section"><b>Longevity in Japan</b><br>
      Because of its robust civil registry, many of those verified as having lived
      the longest are found in the United States; however, there are many
      centenarians living in remote villages in other countries. A peaceful life in
      the countryside seems pretty common among people who have watched a
      century pass.<br>
      Without question, the international superstar of longevity is Japan,
      which has the highest life expectancy of any country in the world. In
      addition to a healthy diet, which we will explore in detail, and an
      integrated health care system in which people go to the doctor for regular
      checkups to prevent disease, longevity in Japan is closely tied to its
      culture, as we will see later on.
      <br>
      The sense of community, and the fact that Japanese people make an
      effort to stay active until the very end, are key elements of their secret to
      long life<br>
      If you want to stay busy even when there's no need to work, there
      has
      to be an ikigai on your horizon, a purpose that guides you throughout your
      life and pushes you to make things of beauty and utility for the
      community and yourself.
