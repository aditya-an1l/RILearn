    <p>NEELU! Neelu!” cried Binya.<br>She scrambled barefoot over the rocks, ran over the short summer
grass, up and over the brow of the hill, all the time calling “Neelu,
Neelu!”</p>
<p>Neelu—Blue—was the name of the blue-grey cow. The other cow,
which was white, was called Gori, meaning Fair One. They were fond of
wandering off on their own, down to the stream or into the pine forest, and
sometimes they came back by themselves and sometimes they stayed away
—almost deliberately, it seemed to Binya.
</p>
<p>If the cows didn’t come home at the right time, Binya would be sent to
fetch them. sometimes her brother Bijju went with her, but these days he
was busy preparing for his exams and didn’t have time to help with the
cows.
</p>
<p>Binya liked being on her own, and sometimes she allowed the cows to
lead her into some distant valley, and then they would all be late coming
home. The cows preferred having Binya with them, because she let them
wander. Bijju pulled them by their tails if they went too far.
</p>
<p>Binya belonged to the mountains, to this part of the Himalayas known
as Garhwal. Dark forests and lonely hilltops held no terrors for her. It was
only when she was in the market-town, jostled by the crowds in the bazaar,
that she felt rather nervous and lost. The town, five miles from the village,
was also a pleasure resort for tourists from all over India.</p>
<p>Binya was probably ten. She may have been nine or even eleven, she
couldn’t be sure because no one in the village kept birthdays; but her
mother told her she’d been born during a winter when the snow had come
up to the windows, and that was just over ten years ago, wasn’t it? Two
years later her father had died; but his passing had made no difference to
their way of life. They had three tiny terraced fields on the side of the
mountain, and they grew potatoes, onions, ginger, beans, mustard and
maize: not enough to sell in the town, but enough to live on.</p>
<p>Like most mountain girls, Binya was quite sturdy, fair of skin, with pink
cheeks and dark eyes and her black hair tied in a pigtail. She wore pretty
glass bangles on her wrists, and a necklace of glass beads. From the
necklace hung a leopard’s claw. It was a lucky charm, and Binya always
wore it. Bijju had one, too, only his was attached to a string.
</p>
<p>Binya’s full name was Binyadevi, and Bijju’s real name was vijay, but
everyone called them Binya and Bijju. Binya was two years younger than
her brother.
</p>
<p>She had stopped calling for Neelu; she had heard the cow-bells tinkling,
and knew the cows hadn’t gone far. Singing to herself, she walked over
fallen pine-needles into the forest glade on the spur of the hill. She heard
voices, laughter, the clatter of plates and cups; and stepping through the
trees, she came upon a party of picnickers.
</p>
<p>They were holiday-makers from the plains. The women were dressed in
bright saris, the men wore light summer shirts, and the children had pretty
new clothes. Binya, standing in the shadows between the trees, went
unnoticed; and for some time she watched the picnickers, admiring their
clothes, listening to their unfamiliar accents, and gazing rather hungrily at
the sight of all their food. And then her gaze came to rest on a bright blue
umbrella, a frilly thing for women, which lay open on the grass beside its
owner</p>
<p>Now Binya had seen umbrellas before, and her mother had a big black
umbrella which nobody used any more because the field-rats had eaten
holes in it, but this was the first time Binya had seen such a small, dainty,
colourful umbrella; and she fell in love with it. The umbrella was like a
flower, a great blue flower that had sprung up on the dry brown hillside.
</p>
<p>She moved forward a few paces so that she could see the umbrella
better. As she came out of the shadows into the sunlight, the picnickers saw
her.
</p>
<p>“Hello, look who’s here!” exclaimed the older of the two women. “A
little village girl!”
</p>
<p>“Isn’t she pretty?” remarked the other. “But how torn and dirty her
clothes are!” it did not seem to bother them that Binya could hear and
understand everything they said about her.</p>
<p>“They’re very poor in the hills,” said one of the men.</p>
<p>“Then let’s give her something to eat.” And the older woman beckoned
to Binya to come closer.</p>
<p>Hesitantly, nervously, Binya approached the group. Normally she would
have turned and fled; but the attraction was the pretty blue umbrella. It had
cast a spell over her, drawing her forward almost against her will.</p>
<p>“What’s that on her neck?” asked the younger woman.</p>
<p>“A necklace of sorts.”</p>
<p>“It’s a pendant—see, there’s a claw hanging from it!”</p>
<p>“It’s a tiger’s claw,” said the man beside her. (He had never seen a
tiger’s claw.) “A lucky charm. These people wear them to keep away evil
spirits.” He looked to Binya for confirmation, but Binya said nothing.</p>
<p>“Oh, I want one too!” said the woman, who was obviously his wife.</p>
<p>“You can’t get them in shops.”
</p>
<p>“Buy hers, then. Give her two or three rupees, she’s sure to need the
money.”</p>
<p>The man, looking slightly embarrassed but anxious to please his young
wife, produced a two-rupee note and offered it to Binya, indicating that he
wanted the pendant in exchange. Binya put her hand to the necklace, half
afraid that the excited woman would snatch it away from her. Solemnly she
shook her head. The man then showed her a five-rupee note, but again
Binya shook her head.
</p>
<p>“How silly she is!” exclaimed the young woman</p>
<p>“It may not be hers to sell,” said the man. “But i’ll try again. How much
do you want—what can we give you?” And he waved his hand towards the
picnic things scattered about on the grass.
</p>
<p>Without any hesitation Binya pointed to the umbrella.
</p>
<p>“My umbrella!” exclaimed the young woman. “She wants my umbrella.
What cheek!”</p>
<p>“Well, you want her pendant, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>“That’s different.”
</p>
<p>“Is it?”
</p>
<p>The man and his wife were beginning to quarrel with each other.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask her to go away,” said the older woman. “We’re making such
fools of ourselves.”
</p>
<p>“But I want the pendant!” cried the other petulantly. And then, on an
impulse, she picked up the umbrella and held it out to Binya. “Here, take
the umbrella!”</p>
<p>Binya removed her necklace and held it out to the young woman, who
immediately placed it round her own neck. Then Binya took the umbrella
and held it up. It did not look so small in her hands; in fact, it was just the
right size.
</p>
<p>She had forgotten about the picnickers, who were busy examining the
pendant. She turned the blue umbrella this way and that; looked through the
bright blue silk at the pulsating sun; and then, still keeping it open, turned
and disappeared into the forest glade.</p>
