          Arundhati Roy is an acclaimed author and activist who won the Booker Prize for her debut novel "The God of
          Small Things,"
          a richly layered story that explores caste, love, and loss in a Kerala family. Her writing is deeply poetic,
          political,
          and complex, often tackling themes of inequality, social injustice, and resistance. Her second novel, "The
          Ministry of
          Utmost Happiness," continues this tradition by focusing on marginalized communities in India. Beyond
          literature, Roy is
          also known for her fearless activism and essays on human rights and environmental issues.
