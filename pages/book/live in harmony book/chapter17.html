    <p>“For most of history, Anonymous was a woman.” –Virginia Woolf</p>
<p>“Why is it called history and not herstory?” –Riane Eisler</p>
<p>“Some people make headlines while others make history.” –Philip Elmer-DeWitt</p>
<p>“Better late than never.” –Titus Livius</p>
<p>“History is the witness that testifies to the passing of time; it illumines reality, vitalizes memory, provides guidance in daily life, and brings us tidings of antiquity.” –Cicero</p>
<p>“History is a voice forever sounding across the centuries the laws of right and wrong. Opinions alter, manners change, creeds rise and fall, but the moral law is written on the tablets of eternity.” –James A. Forude</p>
<p>“History teaches that wars begin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.” –Ronald Reagan</p>
<p>“History repeats itself. That’s one of the things wrong with history.” –Clarence Darrow</p>
<p>“Not the power to conquer others, but the power to become one with others is the ultimate power.” –Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>“We learn from history that we do not learn from history.” –Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel</p>
<p>“This is our opportunity to grab the moment and say, ‘Let me extract out of it all that I can.’ For here is real history in the making. The passage of each moment is real history in the making.” –Prem Rawat</p>
<p>“It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.” –Robert F. Kennedy, South Africa 1966</p>
<p>“History, although sometimes made up of the few acts of the great, is more often shaped by the many acts of the small.” –Mark Yost</p>

<p class="side"> Chapter Story:
</p>
<p> Mother Teresa was born in Skopje, Macedonia on August 27, 1910. Her
 parents were Albanian.   Her name was Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu.  She took the
 name of Mother Teresa later in her life, when she committed herself to life as a
 Catholic nun.
</p>
<p>At the age of 12, Mother Teresa started to have spiritual or religious expe
riences.  In her prayers she felt she was talking to God and she felt that God was
 guiding her.  She started to feel strongly that she would like to do something very
 special in her life.  She was brought up in the Catholic religion and her main
 inspiration was Jesus Christ.  She felt that Jesus was a perfect example for how to
 live her life – a life of helping and giving to others.  She knew she had to be a
 missionary, to spread the love of Christ. At age 18, Mother Teresa left her parents’
 home and joined the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions
 in India.
</p>
<p>After a short period of training, she was sent to India, where, on May 24,
 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun.  Vows are the promises or the commit
ments a woman makes when she becomes a nun.  From 1931-1948 Mother Teresa
 taught at St. Mary’s High School in Calcutta. During this time, the suffering and
 poverty she saw outside the convent school made a deep impression on her. She
 couldn’t believe how poor and how sick people on the streets of Calcutta were.
 Even worse was that it seemed nobody was caring for them.  On the street people
 would just walk by, as if they didn’t even see those who were lying on the side
 too weak to get up or help themselves.  She wondered what she could do to help
 them. She could not bear to watch them each day and to do nothing.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa finally received an answer to her prayers and her questions.
 On a train ride from Calcutta to Darjeeling, India on September 10, 1946 she had
 a vision: She could form a new order of nuns with the mission of helping the
 poor, sick and needy. Since nobody else was doing it, she would do it, and in her
 vision she saw others coming to help her.  Mother Teresa asked permission from
 her superiors to leave the convent school and devote herself to working among
the poorest of the poor in the slums of Calcutta.  She had no money, but she had a
 strong belief that God would help her. She started an open-air school for slum
 children. Soon volunteer helpers came to help because they were inspired. Other
 people who had enough money made donations to help Mother Teresa.  Because
 of the help she received, Mother Teresa was able to expand her work.</p>
<p>On October 7, 1950, Mother Teresa got permission from the pope to start
 her own order of nuns - the Missionaries of Charity.  Its main task was to love
 and care for those people whom nobody else could or would care for.  Soon
 Mother Teresa opened her first home for the destitute and dying, in Calcutta, with
 a staff of 12 nuns, including Mother Teresa herself. Over time, Mother Teresa’s
 mission spread and spread.  Some nuns or sisters who wanted to follow her inspi
ration wanted to focus mostly on prayer and meditation.  For them Mother Teresa
 established a Contemplative Branch of her order. Others wanted to work directly
 with the needy and for them Mother Teresa established the Active Branch of her
 order. In addition, men wanted to join the order and to follow Mother Teresa’s
 leadership.  Mother Teresa established Contemplative and Active Branches of her
 order for men or brothers. Eventually Mother Teresa established a branch for
 priests.  She also encouraged married couples to help in the mission as well.
 Mother Teresa believed everyone could work together!  It was a big job to create
 better conditions for destitute people all over the world.  All of the Branches
 together were called the Society of Missionaries. Over time, they spread all over
 the world
</p>
<p>Mother Teresa’s Society of Missionaries provides help to the poorest of the
 poor in a number of countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America, Russia and Eastern
 Europe. The order consists of over 4,500 nuns and is active in 133 countries.  In
 addition, there are more than one million co-workers who help the mission in a
 wide variety of ways.  They undertake relief work after natural catastrophes such
 as floods, epidemics, and famine and also help with refugees.  The order also has
 houses in North America, Europe and Australia where they take care of shut-ins,
 alcoholics, homeless people, and AIDS sufferers.
</p>
<p> Mother Teresa’s work has been recognized and acclaimed throughout the
 world.  During her lifetime, she received a number of awards and distinctions,
 including the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971) and the Nehru Prize for pro
motion of international peace and understanding (1972). She received the Nobel
 Peace Prize in 1979. Mother Teresa died on September 5, 1997, but her mission is
 strong and continues to grow. Mother Teresa proved that one person could change
 the world.  So many people continue to be inspired by her work and her life, that
 her mission continues to expand to more and more countries around the world.  
</p>
<p>Before Mother Teresa, the poorest of the poor, and the very sick, in India
 and in so many other places, had no hope, no love, and no care.  Because Mother
 Teresa provided food and medical care, and would sit with them and hold their
 189
hands, talk to them, and look into their eyes with the love of her heart, the poor
 and the sick people not only got physical help, but also they did not feel so lonely
 and depressed.  They felt that someone cared about them, and that that their lives
 were meaningful and important. Mother Teresa taught all of her followers how to
 love and care for people in this way.</p>
<p> Before Mother Teresa began her work, most people who had money and a
 good life in India did not know how to help poor people.  It seemed like too big
 of a job and nobody knew where to start. Sometimes, people didn’t even want to
 think about the poor, because their situation was so sad and desperate.  Mother
 Teresa changed all of that. She believed that it was our duty as fellow human
 beings not to forget those who are less fortunate than we are. Because of Mother
 Teresa’s positive attitude towards those who were poor, sick, or dying, the atti
tudes of others started to change as well.  Today, because of Mother Teresa, we
 know that doing something to help, even something small, is much better than
 doing nothing at all.  Mother Teresa was just one person, yet she affected millions
 of people by the way she lived her life.

<p class="side"> Chapter Overview: 
</p>
<p>History is the written story of life on earth.  Sometimes the story of history
 begins with the beginning of the universe, sometimes it begins with the creation
 of the earth, and sometimes it begins with the development of life on earth.  The
 story of history can also begin with the first humans that appeared on earth.  It all
 depends on which story you want to read or tell.  It also depends on when you
 want the story to begin and how long you want it to be.
</p>
<p> History has many different versions. There is not just one history.  In fact
 there are thousands and thousands of history books.  Each story is different,
 depending upon who is telling the story and what part of the story they are telling.
 So how do we know which story is true?  Well, one way is that we can rely on the
 evidence discovered by scientists such as paleontologists, geologists, archeolo
gists, anthropologists, historians, and others.  We can look at the things these sci
entists have discovered and then try to decide what those discoveries mean.</p>
<p> The history of human beings on earth is very long. The first human-like
 creatures appeared on earth millions of years ago.  The earliest humans were not
 that much different from apes.  Gradually, over a long period of time, humans
 learned how to use tools, make fire, and defend themselves against wild animals.
 About 50,000 years ago, human beings made an enormous leap in evolution. This
 was the time of human beings that we now call Cro-Magnon.  The Cro-Magnon
 people were the first people to look like modern human beings. They were also
 the first to make clothes, to create art, to use metal for tools, to think about
 abstract things like heaven or the after-life, and to do many other new things.</p>
<p>Another great leap in human history occurred six to eight thousand years
 ago, when human beings first organized into large communities – sometimes
 called city-states. In this time, people learned how to domesticate animals, grow
 crops, build common defenses, transport water, make jewelry, travel long dis
tances, use boats, roll things on wheels, create written language, trade with others,
 make laws, have ceremonies and celebrations, and do many, many other new
 things. This is the era in which the life of human beings started to resemble
 human life as we know it. During this time, human beings had to learn how to
 cooperate, to share information, and to form creative solutions to problems.  It
 was a very important period in human development.</p>
<p> From this period of about eight thousand years ago, until today, human
 beings have gone through tremendous changes.  First, human beings were telling
 their stories, orally, but then, about five thousand years ago, written language was
 invented. Human beings started writing down their stories, and written history
 was born. During this time period, human beings developed different languages,
 the arts, philosophy, architecture, religion, government, agriculture, warfare, many
 modes of travel, different sources of energy, and all kinds of other things.  As the
 human population grew and humans traveled from one part of the planet to the
 other, people had to face many challenges: how to share land and food, how to
 live peacefully together, how to accept and respect each other’s differences, and
 how to care for those who are sick or needy. The human race has made tremen
dous progress over these last eight thousand years, but we are still learning how
 to best meet these basic challenges.  We are still learning tolerance, respect,
 peacefulness, conflict resolution, cooperation, creative problem solving, sharing,
 and compassion.</p>
<p> Sometimes, when history is written, it seems like human beings are always
 acting badly – being mean or hurting each other, getting into fights and war con
stantly.  When we read this kind of history, it seems as if human beings have
 always been the same, as if they haven’t changed or improved at all over the cen
turies.  Looking at history this way, for example, it seems that war is always
 going to happen – that war is the only way human beings know how to solve
 problems.  </p>
<p>But that is only one way of looking at history.  The other way to look at
 history is to see that human beings are constantly learning, changing, evolving
 and improving. To look at history this way, we have to pay close attention to the
 little changes and improvements in human culture throughout the ages.  We also
 have to learn more about the human beings who have helped humanity to move
 forward and make progress.  Instead of focusing on the wars and the bad things in
 history we have to celebrate the positive achievements of human beings. Then we
 can begin to see properly where we have come from and where we might be
 going as a human family on planet earth.</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 - Make a chart of inventions </p>
<p>In this lesson we will make a chart of the significant inventions in history.
 Our chart will have three parts: one column will be for ‘Good Inventions’; one
 column will be for ‘Bad Inventions’; and one column will be for ‘In-Between
 Inventions’.  Good inventions are things that have been good for human beings
 and have had only a positive impact.  Bad inventions are things that have not
 been good for human beings and have had mostly a negative impact.  In-between
 inventions are inventions that have been somewhat good and somewhat bad.</p>
<p> We will break up into groups of 3-5 people. Each group will discuss the
 inventions one at a time for a short time. Then the group will vote on which col
umn to put the invention in.  Once you have voted, write the invention in the col
umn based upon your group’s vote.  The list of inventions is below. Your group
 can add inventions to the list if you have enough time. We will discuss each
 group's voting results once we are finished.

<p class="side"> Lesson #2 - The great ideas of history </p>
<p> It is hard for us to imagine a world without art or music or democracy or
 conflict resolution.  These great ideas have become very important parts of our
 lives.  They help us to live in peace, to share, to enjoy ourselves, and to plan for
 future generations. Yet there was a time when these ideas did not exist.  Someone,
 once upon a time, had to create each one of them. Choose one of the great ideas
 of humanity below and try to imagine how it might have first come to be.  First
 draw a picture or write a story about this imaginary beginning.  Then we will
 share our stories and drawings.  We will select a few of the stories to turn into
 skits showing our imaginary version of how some of these great ideas came to be
</p>

<p class="side"> Lesson #3 - The time machine</p>
<p> Close your eyes and imagine you have a time machine.  In this time
 machine you can travel back in time as far as you want to. You can go back to the
time of the dinosaurs, the time of Neanderthal people, the time of an ancient civi
lization, the time of the knights in armor, the time of Shakespeare, or any other
 time. Imagine yourself going back in time to a certain point in history to meet
 somebody special, to help somebody, to do something special, to change the
 course of history, or to stop something from happening. Where would you like to
 go? What would you like to do? Imagine yourself at that point in time. What was
 it like back then?  How was it different from today? Imagine yourself going back
 in time, and doing the special thing you want to do.  Later, after we open our
 eyes, we will draw a picture of ourselves going back in time.  In your picture try
 to show yourself and the place you are in.  Make sure you draw something that
 shows the time you went back to. After we do our drawings we will share about
 which point in history we went back to.
</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #4 - Important people in human history
</p>
<p> Millions of people in history have helped humanity move forward and
 make progress in small and big ways. Certain individuals have made very impor
tant contributions to human history. They have created ideas or inventions that
 changed the course of human history in very positive ways.  A few of them are
 listed below along with their accomplishments.  Choose one person from the list
 that you would like to learn more about. Use the following outline to answer and
 write down some important  information about the person you have chosen</p>
 <p>a) Write the person’s full name.</p>
<p>b) When did the person live?</p>
<p>c) Where did the person live?</p>
<p>d) What was the person’s main accomplishment or achievement?</p>
<p>e) Did the person’s accomplishments inspire others? If yes, what kinds of organizations, movements, or institutions, traditions, or ideas were started due to the inspiration of this person? Give some details, including whether the organization, tradition, or ideas are still happening today.</p>
<p>f) Write down any famous or interesting quotations from the person that explain their philosophy or express their unique spirit.</p>
<p>g) Write down any other interesting facts about this person that you would like to remember or share with others.</p>
<p>h) After doing your research and writing your answers, make either a drawing of your person or a map of where they lived or traveled.</p>
<p>i) We will choose a day on which we will each dress as the character we have studied. In costume, the characters will make a short speech about who they are, when and where they lived, and what their main accomplishments were. If possible we can make a video of our presentations. Here is the list of names you can choose from, grouped according to the different fields of achievement.</p>

<p> Let’s close our eyes for a few minutes and think about some things.  Our
 world today is very different from the way it was five thousand, fifty thousand, or
 five hundred thousand years ago.  Human beings today are also very different
 from how they were in times past. In the distant future, as evolution continues,
 what will the earth be like?  As human beings continue to learn from their mis
takes and to change, what will human beings be like? Will they look different?
 Will they act differently towards each other?  Will they solve conflicts in a more
 peaceful way?  How will they solve the most difficult problems – such as war,
 poverty, and pollution?  Spend a little time imagining this future world.  Then we
 will hear from everybody about what they imagined.  We will write a little bit of
 each person’s vision on the board in front of the room.  Then we will make a
 story or a group collage using elements of everyone’s vision combined.</p>
<p> Lesson #6 - Some of the things that changed history
</p>
<p> Certain crops, products and natural resources have played a major role in human
 evolution.  Research the history of one of the items below and write a short sum
mary about the importance of this product or natural resource in history and the
 impact of this product on humanity.  Remember that the impact of the product can
 be positive or negative or sometimes both. Here is the list of products and natural
 resources:</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
  <li><p>bronze</p></li>
  <li><p>iron</p></li>
  <li><p>tin</p></li>
  <li><p>silver</p></li>
  <li><p>tea</p></li>
  <li><p>sugar</p></li>
  <li><p>corn</p></li>
  <li><p>rice</p></li>
  <li><p>rum</p></li>
  <li><p>salt</p></li>
  <li><p>pepper</p></li>
  <li><p>coal</p></li>
  <li><p>gems</p></li>
  <li><p>copper</p></li>
  <li><p>steel</p></li>
  <li><p>gold</p></li>
  <li><p>fur</p></li>
  <li><p>coffee</p></li>
  <li><p>wheat</p></li>
  <li><p>cotton</p></li>
  <li><p>chocolate</p></li>
  <li><p>tobacco</p></li>
  <li><p>cinnamon</p></li>
  <li><p>rubber</p></li>
  <li><p>petroleum</p></li>
  <li><p>wood</p></li>
</ul>
</p><p class="side">Discussion Questions:</p>
<p>a)  Clarence Darrow said, “History repeats itself. That’s one of the things wrong
 with history.”  Georg Hegel said, “We learn from history that we do not learn
 from history.”  These are both somewhat pessimistic ways of looking at history.
 In this chapter and in this book we are discovering that people do learn from his
tory, even though it might seem we are learning slowly.  The more we study his
tory and understand the mistakes of the past, the faster humanity can progress.
 Each time we can avoid the mistakes of the past and make positive changes we
 can move evolution forward.  As Titus Livius said, “Better late than never.” In
 other words, it is never too late to try to do something good and to try to create
 progressive changes.  Discuss these quotes in light of the challenge and impor
tance of keeping a positive attitude as we think about history and actively make
 history.
</p>
<p>b)  The first two quotations above are about the place of women in history.  Of
 course, women have made just as many positive contributions to the world as
 men have.  However, most traditional history books talk much more about men
 than women.  Can you think of some reasons why this might be?</p>
 <p> c)   Discuss what you think was the turning point in Mother Teresa’s life. What
 was the one thing that changed the direction of her life and placed her on the path
 towards her great achievements?  There might be more than one answer!</p>
 <p class="side"> Supplemental Activities:</p>
 <p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Choose any of the lessons above and make a crossword, acrostic, or word-find
 puzzle using the words or names in that lesson.  Photocopy the puzzles and give
 them out for the rest the class to solve.  Make sure you draw and write your puz
zles neatly and clearly if you want others to be able to enjoy them -  or better yet
 type your puzzles.  Don’t forget to include a title or a heading and instructions for
 your puzzle.  Good luck and have fun!</p></li>
 <li><p> Older students are emotionally and intellectually prepared to engage some of the
 more disturbing ‘mistakes’ of humanity.  These things are very painful and upset
ting to learn about, but the best way, and perhaps the only way, for human beings
 not to repeat the mistakes of the past is to face them, learn about them,  and ask
 what caused them to happen. Once we know the source of these mistakes – the
 main things that caused them – then we will be empowered to change things so
 that the causes of the mistakes cease to exist.
Choose one of the following terms.  Write down the term and its definition and
 then research the term and write a brief description of one instance in history
 where this type of event or incident happened or one place in the world where it
 is still happening.  Be sure to indicate the date, the place, and the culture, nation,
 race, or people that were affected.
 Terms to choose from:</p></li>

  <li><p>genocide</p></li>
  <li><p>atom bomb</p></li>
  <li><p>epidemic</p></li>
  <li><p>Black Death</p></li>
