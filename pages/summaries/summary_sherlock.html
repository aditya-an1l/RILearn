    <h3>Chapter 1 – A Scandal in Bohemia</h3>
    <p>
      In this thrilling opening story, Sherlock Holmes is visited by the King of Bohemia, who is soon to be married. However, his past affair with an opera singer, Irene Adler, threatens to cause a scandal if a photograph of them together is revealed. The King describes Adler as clever, independent, and cunning — a woman who has outmaneuvered many. Holmes sets out to retrieve the photo using a combination of disguises and observation. Disguising himself as a clergyman, Holmes stages a fake fire to locate the hidden photograph. Just when he prepares to retrieve it, Adler, having suspected Holmes's identity, flees the country with her new husband, leaving a letter behind. In it, she promises not to expose the King, as she no longer desires revenge. Holmes is left impressed by her intelligence, forever referring to her respectfully as “the woman.” This case is significant as one of the few where Holmes is outwitted, not by a criminal but by a clever and principled woman.

    <h3>Chapter 2 – The Red-Headed League</h3>
    <p>
      Jabez Wilson, a London pawnbroker with striking red hair, brings an unusual mystery to Holmes. He was offered a well-paying, meaningless job copying out the encyclopedia simply because of his red hair, under the employment of the so-called Red-Headed League. After weeks, the League is suddenly dissolved. Holmes, intrigued, visits Wilson’s shop, noting the behavior of his assistant Vincent Spaulding. Through clever deduction, Holmes realizes the job was a ploy to get Wilson out of his shop while criminals dug a tunnel from the cellar to a neighboring bank. On the night of the planned robbery, Holmes, Watson, and the police catch the thieves in the act, revealing Spaulding to be the infamous criminal John Clay. This story exemplifies how even the most bizarre situations can mask dangerous schemes and highlights Holmes’s unique skill in seeing connections others miss.

    <h3>Chapter 3 – A Case of Identity</h3>
    <p>
      Miss Mary Sutherland, a wealthy young woman, is devastated when her fiancé, Hosmer Angel, vanishes on their wedding day. She comes to Holmes for help, describing how Angel was secretive — meeting her only in shadows, refusing to be seen by others, and communicating solely by typewritten letters. Holmes quickly senses deceit and suspects someone close to Mary is behind the incident. Investigating, he concludes that Hosmer Angel was, in fact, Mary’s stepfather, James Windibank, in disguise. Windibank intended to prevent her marriage and maintain access to her inheritance. Holmes exposes the cruel manipulation but, bound by legal limitations and concern for Mary’s fragile state, chooses not to confront her with the truth. This story illustrates Holmes’s sharp insight into human psychology and the lengths to which greed can corrupt.

    <h3>Chapter 4 – The Boscombe Valley Mystery</h3>
    <p>
      Holmes is called to Boscombe Valley to assist in a murder investigation where young James McCarthy stands accused of killing his father, Charles McCarthy, following a public quarrel. Witnesses report heated arguments and suspicious behavior. Holmes carefully examines the scene, noting clues others overlook, such as footprints and a dying man’s cryptic utterance: "a rat." Through these details and clever deduction, Holmes uncovers the past connection between Charles McCarthy and John Turner, a local landowner with a criminal history in Australia. Turner, desperate to prevent McCarthy from forcing his daughter into marriage, murdered him. Turner confesses privately to Holmes, who, in an act of compassion, keeps the confession secret, knowing Turner’s health is failing. This story delves into themes of justice, moral dilemmas, and past sins resurfacing.

    <h3>Chapter 5 –The Five Orange Pips </h3>
    <p>
      John Openshaw seeks Holmes’s help after his uncle and father die under mysterious circumstances following the receipt of envelopes containing five orange pips — symbols of death from an American secret society, the Ku Klux Klan. Now Openshaw receives the same ominous warning. Holmes, connecting the cases and using ship registries, identifies the likely murderers aboard a vessel heading back to America. Tragically, before he can act, Openshaw is found drowned. Holmes vows revenge and sends a warning to the culprits, but fate intervenes as the ship and its crew perish at sea. This grim tale highlights Holmes’s relentless pursuit of justice and the chilling reach of vengeance and secret societies.

    <h3>Chapter 6 – The Man with the Twisted Lip</h3>
    <p>
      Neville St. Clair, a respected businessman, vanishes mysteriously, last seen at a seedy opium den in London’s East End. His wife, certain she glimpsed him through a window, finds no trace after the police raid the building. A beggar known as Hugh Boone is arrested. Holmes, examining clues and inconsistencies, suspects Boone’s identity. In a dramatic moment, Holmes washes away Boone’s disguise to reveal Neville St. Clair. St. Clair confesses he led a double life, finding begging far more profitable than his business. The disappearance was an accident when his wife unexpectedly arrived at the den. Holmes agrees to keep the secret for the family’s sake. This case explores themes of duality, deception, and society’s blindness to appearances.
