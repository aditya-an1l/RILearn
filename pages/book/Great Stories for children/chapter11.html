      <p>When the Trees Walked</p>
    </h1>
    <p>One morning while I was sitting beside Grandfather on the veranda steps, I noticed
the tendril of a creeping vine trailing nearby. As we sat there in the soft sunshine
of a North Indian winter, I saw the tendril moving slowly towards Grandfather. Twenty
minutes later, it had crossed the step and was touching his feet.
</p>
<p>There is probably a scientific explanation for the plant’s behaviour – something to
do with light and warmth perhaps – but I liked to think it moved across the steps simply
because it wanted to be near Grandfather. One always felt like drawing close to him.
Sometimes when I sat by myself beneath a tree, I would feel rather lonely but as soon as
Grandfather joined me, the garden became a happy place. Grandfather had served many
years in the Indian Forest Service and it was natural that he should know trees and like
them. On his retirement, he built a bungalow on the outskirts of Dehradun, planting trees
all around. Lime, mango, orange and guava, also eucalyptus, jacaranda, and Persian
lilacs. In the fertile Doon Valley, plants and trees grew tall and strong.</p>
<p>There were other trees in the compound before the house was built, including an old
peepul that had forced its way through the walls of an abandoned outhouse, knocking
the bricks down with its vigorous growth. Peepul trees are great show offs. Even when
there is no breeze, their broad-chested, slim-waisted leaves will spin like tops
determined to attract your attention and invite you into the shade. Grandmother had
wanted the peepul tree cut down but Grandfather had said, ‘Let it be, we can always
build another outhouse.’
</p>
<p>Grandmother didn’t mind trees, but she preferred growing flowers and was
constantly ordering catalogues and seeds. Grandfather helped her out with the gardening
not because he was crazy about flower gardens but because he liked watching
butterflies and ‘there’s only one way to attract butterflies,’ he said, ‘and that is to grow
flowers for them.’
</p>
<p>Grandfather wasn’t content with growing trees in our compound. During the rains, he
would walk into the jungle beyond the river-bed armed with cuttings and saplings
which he would plant in the forest.
</p>
<p>‘But no one ever comes here!’ I had protested, the first time we did this. ‘Who’s
going to see them?’
</p>
<p>‘See, we’re not planting them simply to improve the view,’ replied Grandfather.
‘We’re planting them for the forest and for the animals and birds who live here and
need more food and shelter.’</p>
<p>‘Of course, men need trees too,’ he added. ‘To keep the desert away, to attract rain,
to prevent the banks of rivers from being washed away, for fruit and flowers, leaf and
seed. Yes, for timber too. But men are cutting down trees without replacing them and if
we don’t plant a few trees ourselves, a time will come when the world will be one
great desert.’</p>
<p>The thought of a world without trees became a sort of nightmare to me and I helped
Grandfather in his tree-planting with greater enthusiasm. And while we went about our
work, he taught me a poem by George Morris:</p>
<p>Woodman, spare that tree!<br>
Touch not a single bough!<br>
In youth it sheltered me,<br>
And I’ll protect it now.</p>
<p>‘One day the trees will move again,’ said Grandfather. ‘They’ve been standing still
for thousands of years but there was a time when they could walk about like people.
Then along came an interfering busybody who cast a spell over them, rooting them to
one place. But they’re always trying to move. See how they reach out with their arms!
And some of them, like the banyan tree with its travelling aerial roots, manage to get
quite far.’</p>
<p>We found an island, a small rocky island in a dry river-bed. It was one of those
river-beds so common in the foothills, which are completely dry in summer but flooded
during the monsoon rains. A small mango was growing on the island. ‘If a small tree
can grow here,’ said Grandfather, ‘so can others.’ As soon as the rains set in and while
rivers could still be crossed, we set out with a number of tamarind, laburnum, and coral
tree saplings and cuttings and spent the day planting them on the island.
</p>
<p>The monsoon season was the time for rambling about. At every turn, there was
something new to see. Out of the earth and rock and leafless boughs, the magic touch of
the rains had brought life and greenness. You could see the broad-leaved vines
growing. Plants sprang up in the most unlikely of places. A peepul would take root in
the ceiling, a mango would sprout on the window-sill. We did not like to remove them
but they had to go if the house was to be kept from falling down.</p>
<p>‘If you want to live in a tree, that’s all right by me,’ said Grandmother crossly. ‘But I
like having a roof over my head and I’m not going to have my roof brought down by the
jungle.’</p>
<p>Then came the Second World War and I was sent away to a boarding school. During
the holidays, I went to live with my father in Delhi. Meanwhile, my grandparents sold
the house and went to England. Two or three years later, I too went to England and was
away from India for several years.</p>
<p>Some years later, I returned to Dehradun. After first visiting the old house – it hadn’t
changed much – I walked out of town towards the river-bed. It was February. As I
looked across the dry water-course, my eye was immediately caught by the spectacular
red blooms of the coral blossom. In contrast with the dry river-bed, the island was a
small green paradise. When I went up to the trees, I noticed that some squirrels were
living in them and a koel, a crow pheasant, challenged me with a mellow ‘who-are-you,
who-are-you’.
</p>
<p>But the trees seemed to know me; they whispered among themselves and beckoned
me nearer. And looking around I noticed that other smaller trees, wild plants and
grasses had sprung up under their protection. Yes, the trees we had planted long ago had
multiplied. They were walking again. In one small corner of the world, Grandfather’s
dream had come true.</p>
