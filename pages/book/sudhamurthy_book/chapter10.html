      The American education system at the university level is different from ours.
      There, the final marks are based on the average marks of three examinations
      held earlier in the semester. As a result, students have to study and do well
      consistently, and there is not much pressure during the final exam. There is
      also greater student-teacher interaction in that system.</p>

    <p>As a teacher, I have seen that sometimes even a bright student may not do
      well because of the pressures of the final test. There are other ways to
      examine the depth of knowledge of the student, like surprise exams, open
      book exams, oral exams etc. The examination should not scare the students,
      instead it should measure their knowledge fairly and give marks accordingly.
      This kind of system requires more number of teachers for students. However,
      this is difficult to achieve in India, where there are large numbers of students.
      There is also great pressure on students from the parents and society to
      perform well.</p>

    <p> My son is studying in a college in the US. He loves Computer Science
      immensely and always puts in a lot of hard work when he studies it. One day,
      he called me after his mid-term exams. I could make out from his voice that
      he was very sad. He told me, ‚ÄòI did not do my exams well. It is not that I did
      not know the answers, but instead of digit eight I assumed the digit as six and
      did the entire calculation based on that. I prepared so well and now I know I
      will not do well. I'm feeling very depressed.‚Äô</p>

    <p>As a teacher, I don't give too much of importance to marks because I am
      aware of such situations. Many a time I have seen children who are really
      good in subjects unable to answer questions due to various factors. So I
      consoled him.</p>

    <p>'Don't worry. So what? You have lost the battle but you will win the war.
      Examinations are not the only index in life. Keep courage, face reality and
      don't be negligent while reading the questions. Good luck for next time.'</p>

    <p>He was not at all pleased to hear my words. 'You talk like a moral science
      teacher, Amma. It is very competitive here and difficult to achieve anything
      in such an atmosphere. You are a teacher and you only give grades. You don't sit
      for the exams. So you do not know the difficulties of students.'</p>

    <p> I knew he was sad. My consolation did not help him. But he had forgotten
      that once upon a time I was also a student and had passed through the same
      passage.</p>

    <p>After few days, I got another call from him. There was joy and great
      enthusiasm in his voice. Suddenly the dark winter days had turned into bright
      sunny days. </p>

    <p>'Amma, you know I got grade "A" in that subject, which I did not do well.'
      'How come?' I was very surprised.</p>

    <p>'It is a very funny thing. After the exam I was talking to the professor and
      we were discussing various topics. When I got my papers I saw I had got
      good marks for the question which I had answered wrongly. My other friends
      said the professor must have made a mistake, don't tell him, keep quiet.
      Getting a good grade is more important in this competitive world.'</p>

    <p>'What did you do?' I asked anxiously.</p>

    <p>'I thought for a while, then I realized, grades are important but honesty
      is even more important. You taught me that when I was a little boy. Do you
      remember, Amma? Once the shopkeeper mistook fifty rupees as one hundred
      rupees and gave the change for one hundred. At that time we did not have
      much money, but still you sent me back to the shop to return the extra money.
      At that age I was so reluctant to go and return the change but you were strict
      with me and said if I didn't, I would have to go without dinner. Somehow I
      was unable to keep quiet about the professor's mistake. I wrote an email to
      him saying I did not deserve those marks. But his reply was more surprising.'
      'What was that?'/p>

    <p>'He replied, "I have not given the marks by mistake. It was deliberate.
      After the exams I was talking to you, and my constant interaction with you
      throughout the semester had convinced me of the depth of your knowledge
      and your passion for the subject. Mistakes do happen by oversight or due to
      tension. That is the reason I gave you some marks for that question. After all,
      exams should also measure the depth of your knowledge."'</p>

    <p>My eyes filled with tears on hearing this story. I was happy not because he
      had got an 'A' grade but because he had practised what he believed in. Many
      of my own students have behaved in a similar way in different situations,
      though they may have lost a lot in the process. To some people it may seem to
      be stupidity. But I am sure the good values they have learnt will help them in
      any crisis.</p>
