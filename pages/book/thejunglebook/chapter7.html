      <p>The White Seal</p>
    </h1>
    <p >
Oh! hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us,<br>
    And black are the waters that sparkled so green.<br>
The moon, o’er the combers, looks downward to find us<br>
    At rest in the hollows that rustle between.<br>
Where billow meets billow, then soft be thy pillow,<br>
    Ah, weary wee flipperling, curl at thy ease!<br>
The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee,<br>
    Asleep in the arms of the slow-swinging seas!<br>
<br>
<i>Seal Lullaby</i>
</p>
<p>
All these things happened several years ago at a place called Novastoshnah, or
North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and away in the Bering Sea.
Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale when he was blown on to the
rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I took him down into my cabin and
warmed and fed him for a couple of days till he was fit to fly back to St.
Paul’s again. Limmershin is a very quaint little bird, but he knows how to tell
the truth.
</p>
<p>
Nobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people who have
regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer months by
hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea. For Novastoshnah
Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any place in all the world.
</p>
<p>
Sea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place he
happened to be in—would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for Novastoshnah and
spend a month fighting with his companions for a good place on the rocks, as
close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was fifteen years old, a huge gray fur
seal with almost a mane on his shoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he
heaved himself up on his front flippers he stood more than four feet clear of
the ground, and his weight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was
nearly seven hundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage
fights, but he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head
on one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face; then he
would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were firmly fixed on
the other seal’s neck, the other seal might get away if he could, but Sea Catch
would not help him.
</p>
<p>
Yet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules of the
Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as there were forty
or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same thing each spring, the
whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the beach was something
frightful.
</p>
<p>
From a little hill called Hutchinson’s Hill, you could look over three and a
half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was dotted all
over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their share of the
fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the sand, and they fought
on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries, for they were just as stupid
and unaccommodating as men. Their wives never came to the island until late in
May or early in June, for they did not care to be torn to pieces; and the young
two-, three-, and four-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went
inland about half a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on
the sand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green thing
that grew. They were called the holluschickie—the bachelors—and there were
perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah alone.
</p>
<p>
Sea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when Matkah, his
soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea, and he caught her by the
scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his reservation, saying gruffly:
“Late as usual. Where have you been?”
</p>
<p>
It was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four months he
stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad. Matkah knew better
than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: “How thoughtful of you. You’ve
taken the old place again.”
</p>
<p>
“I should think I had,” said Sea Catch. “Look at me!”
</p>
<p>
He was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out, and his
sides were torn to ribbons.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you men, you men!” Matkah said, fanning herself with her hind flipper.
“Why can’t you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You look as though
you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The beach is
disgracefully crowded this season. I’ve met at least a hundred seals from
Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why can’t people stay where they belong?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter Island
instead of this crowded place,” said Matkah.
</p>
<p>
“Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they would
say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.”
</p>
<p>
Sea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended to go
to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a sharp lookout for
a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were on the land, you could
hear their clamor miles out to sea above the loudest gales. At the lowest
counting there were over a million seals on the beach—old seals, mother seals,
tiny babies, and holluschickie, fighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and
playing together—going down to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and
regiments, lying over every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and
skirmishing about in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at
Novastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look all
pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.
</p>
<p>
Kotick, Matkah’s baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he was all
head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals must be, but
there was something about his coat that made his mother look at him very
closely.
</p>
<p>
“Sea Catch,” she said, at last, “our baby’s going to be white!”
</p>
<p>
“Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!” snorted Sea Catch. “There never has been
such a thing in the world as a white seal.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t help that,” said Matkah; “there’s going to be now.” And she sang the
low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their babies:
</p>
<p >
You mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks old,<br>
    Or your head will be sunk by your heels;<br>
And summer gales and Killer Whales<br>
    Are bad for baby seals.<br>
<br>
Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,<br>
    As bad as bad can be;<br>
But splash and grow strong,<br>
And you can’t be wrong.<br>
    Child of the Open Sea!
</p>
<p>
Of course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He paddled
and scrambled about by his mother’s side, and learned to scuffle out of the way
when his father was fighting with another seal, and the two rolled and roared
up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go to sea to get things to eat,
and the baby was fed only once in two days, but then he ate all he could and
throve upon it.
</p>
<p>
The first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens of thousands
of babies of his own age, and they played together like puppies, went to sleep
on the clean sand, and played again. The old people in the nurseries took no
notice of them, and the holluschickie kept to their own grounds, and the babies
had a beautiful playtime.
</p>
<p>
When Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight to their
playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until she heard
Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight lines in his
direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking the youngsters head
over heels right and left. There were always a few hundred mothers hunting for
their children through the playgrounds, and the babies were kept lively. But,
as Matkah told Kotick, “So long as you don’t lie in muddy water and get mange,
or rub the hard sand into a cut or scratch, and so long as you never go
swimming when there is a heavy sea, nothing will hurt you here.”
</p>
<p>
Little seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy till
they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave carried him
out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little hind flippers flew
up exactly as his mother had told him in the song, and if the next wave had not
thrown him back again he would have drowned.
</p>
<p>
After that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the waves
just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always kept his eye
open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks learning to use his
flippers; and all that while he floundered in and out of the water, and coughed
and grunted and crawled up the beach and took catnaps on the sand, and went
back again, until at last he found that he truly belonged to the water.
</p>
<p>
Then you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking under
the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a swash and a
splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or standing up on his
tail and scratching his head as the old people did; or playing “I’m the King of
the Castle” on slippery, weedy rocks that just stuck out of the wash. Now and
then he would see a thin fin, like a big shark’s fin, drifting along close to
shore, and he knew that that was the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young
seals when he can get them; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow,
and the fin would jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
Late in October the seals began to leave St. Paul’s for the deep sea, by
families and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries, and the
holluschickie played anywhere they liked. “Next year,” said Matkah to Kotick,
“you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must learn how to catch fish.”
</p>
<p>
They set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how to sleep
on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his little nose just
out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the long, rocking swell of the
Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all over, Matkah told him he was
learning the “feel of the water,” and that tingly, prickly feelings meant bad
weather coming, and he must swim hard and get away.
</p>
<div >

<p ><b>Ten fathoms deep</b></p>
</div>
<p>
“In a little time,” she said, “you’ll know where to swim to, but just now we’ll
follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he is very wise.” A school of porpoises were
ducking and tearing through the water, and little Kotick followed them as fast
as he could. “How do you know where to go to?” he panted. The leader of the
school rolled his white eye and ducked under. “My tail tingles, youngster,” he
said. “That means there’s a gale behind me. Come along! When you’re south of
the Sticky Water [he meant the Equator] and your tail tingles, that means
there’s a gale in front of you and you must head north. Come along! The water
feels bad here.”
</p>
<p>
This was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always
learning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the
under-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds; how to
skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart like a rifle
bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes ran; how to dance on
the top of the waves when the lightning was racing all over the sky, and wave
his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed Albatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as
they went down the wind; how to jump three or four feet clear of the water like
a dolphin, flippers close to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish
alone because they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at
full speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a ship,
but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick did not know
about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all that time he never
set flipper on dry ground.
</p>
<p>
One day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water somewhere off
the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all over, just as human
people do when the spring is in their legs, and he remembered the good firm
beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles away, the games his companions
played, the smell of the seaweed, the seal roar, and the fighting. That very
minute he turned north, swimming steadily, and as he went on he met scores of
his mates, all bound for the same place, and they said: “Greeting, Kotick! This
year we are all holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers
off Lukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?”
</p>
<p>
Kotick’s fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of it, he
only said, “Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land.” And so they all
came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the old seals, their
fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.
</p>
<p>
That night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea is
full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to Lukannon,
and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a flaming flash
when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent streaks and swirls.
Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds and rolled up and down in
the new wild wheat and told stories of what they had done while they had been
at sea. They talked about the Pacific as boys would talk about a wood that they
had been nutting in, and if anyone had understood them he could have gone away
and made such a chart of that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old
holluschickie romped down from Hutchinson’s Hill crying: “Out of the way,
youngsters! The sea is deep and you don’t know all that’s in it yet. Wait till
you’ve rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white coat?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t get it,” said Kotick. “It grew.” And just as he was going to roll the
speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces came from behind
a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man before, coughed and lowered
his head. The holluschickie just bundled off a few yards and sat staring
stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick Booterin, the chief of the
seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon, his son. They came from the little
village not half a mile from the sea nurseries, and they were deciding what
seals they would drive up to the killing pens—for the seals were driven just
like sheep—to be turned into seal-skin jackets later on.
</p>
<p>
“Ho!” said Patalamon. “Look! There’s a white seal!”
</p>
<p>
Kerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was an
Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a prayer.
“Don’t touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal since—since I
was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof’s ghost. He was lost last year in the big
gale.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not going near him,” said Patalamon. “He’s unlucky. Do you really think he
is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him for some gulls’ eggs.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t look at him,” said Kerick. “Head off that drove of four-year-olds. The
men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it’s the beginning of the season and
they are new to the work. A hundred will do. Quick!”
</p>
<p>
Patalamon rattled a pair of seal’s shoulder bones in front of a herd of
holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he stepped near
and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland, and they never
tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
seals watched them being driven, but they went on playing just the same. Kotick
was the only one who asked questions, and none of his companions could tell him
anything, except that the men always drove seals in that way for six weeks or
two months of every year.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to follow,” he said, and his eyes nearly popped out of his head as
he shuffled along in the wake of the herd.
</p>
<p>
“The white seal is coming after us,” cried Patalamon. “That’s the first time a
seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone.”
</p>
<p>
“Hsh! Don’t look behind you,” said Kerick. “It is Zaharrof’s ghost! I must
speak to the priest about this.”
</p>
<p>
The distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an hour
to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they would get
heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they were skinned. So
they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion’s Neck, past Webster House, till they
came to the Salt House just beyond the sight of the seals on the beach. Kotick
followed, panting and wondering. He thought that he was at the world’s end, but
the roar of the seal nurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a
train in a tunnel. Then Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy
pewter watch and let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could
hear the fog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each
with an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick pointed
out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions or too hot,
and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made of the skin of a
walrus’s throat, and then Kerick said, “Let go!” and then the men clubbed the
seals on the head as fast as they could.
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more, for
their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers, whipped off and
thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough for Kotick. He turned and
galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for a short time) back to the sea; his
little new mustache bristling with horror. At Sea Lion’s Neck, where the great
sea lions sit on the edge of the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into
the cool water and rocked there, gasping miserably. “What’s here?” said a sea
lion gruffly, for as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.
</p>
<p>
“Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!” (“I’m lonesome, very lonesome!”) said Kotick.
“They’re killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!”
</p>
<p>
The Sea Lion turned his head inshore. “Nonsense!” he said. “Your friends are
making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick polishing off a
drove. He’s done that for thirty years.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s horrible,” said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and
steadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him all
standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.
</p>
<p>
“Well done for a yearling!” said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good
swimming. “I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it, but if
you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get to know of it,
and unless you can find an island where no men ever come you will always be
driven.”
</p>
<p>
“Isn’t there any such island?” began Kotick.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I can’t say I’ve
found it yet. But look here—you seem to have a fondness for talking to your
betters—suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to Sea Vitch. He may know
something. Don’t flounce off like that. It’s a six-mile swim, and if I were you
I should haul out and take a nap first, little one.”
</p>
<p>
Kotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own beach,
hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as seals will. Then
he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet of rocky island almost
due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and rock and gulls’ nests, where
the walrus herded by themselves.
</p>
<p>
He landed close to old Sea Vitch—the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled, fat-necked,
long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners except when he is
asleep—as he was then, with his hind flippers half in and half out of the surf.
</p>
<p>
“Wake up!” barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.
</p>
<p>
“Hah! Ho! Hmph! What’s that?” said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next walrus a
blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the next, and so on
till they were all awake and staring in every direction but the right one.
</p>
<div >
<img alt="image" src="Screenshot 2025-07-05 155553.png" >
<p ><b>They were all awake and staring in every direction but the
right one.</b></p>
</div>
<p>
“Hi! It’s me,” said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a little white
slug.
</p>
<p>
“Well! May I be—skinned!” said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick as you
can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a little boy.
Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just then; he had seen
enough of it. So he called out: “Isn’t there any place for seals to go where
men don’t ever come?”
</p>
<p>
“Go and find out,” said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. “Run away. We’re busy
here.”
</p>
<p>
Kotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could:
“Clam-eater! Clam-eater!” He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in his
life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to be a very
terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies and the
Epatkas—the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the Puffins, who are
always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the cry, and—so Limmershin told
me—for nearly five minutes you could not have heard a gun fired on Walrus
Islet. All the population was yelling and screaming “Clam-eater! Stareek [old
man]!” while Sea Vitch rolled from side to side grunting and coughing.
</p>
<p>
“Now will you tell?” said Kotick, all out of breath.
</p>
<p>
“Go and ask Sea Cow,” said Sea Vitch. “If he is living still, he’ll be able to
tell you.”
</p>
<p>
“How shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him?” said Kotick, sheering off.
</p>
<p>
“He’s the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch,” screamed a Burgomaster
gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch’s nose. “Uglier, and with worse manners!
Stareek!”
</p>
<p>
Kotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he found
that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover a quiet
place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven the
holluschickie—it was part of the day’s work—and that if he did not like to see
ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds. But none of the
other seals had seen the killing, and that made the difference between him and
his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white seal.
</p>
<p>
“What you must do,” said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his son’s
adventures, “is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have a
nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another five years
you ought to be able to fight for yourself.” Even gentle Matkah, his mother,
said: “You will never be able to stop the killing. Go and play in the sea,
Kotick.” And Kotick went off and danced the Fire-dance with a very heavy little
heart.
</p>
<p>
That autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone because of
a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow, if there was such a
person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet island with good firm
beaches for seals to live on, where men could not get at them. So he explored
and explored by himself from the North to the South Pacific, swimming as much
as three hundred miles in a day and a night. He met with more adventures than
can be told, and narrowly escaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the
Spotted Shark, and the Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians
that loaf up and down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet
spotted scallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow
very proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island that
he could fancy.
</p>
<p>
If the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play on,
there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down blubber,
and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that seals had once
visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew that where men had come
once they would come again.
</p>
<p>
He picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that Kerguelen
Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick went down there
he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked black cliffs in a heavy
sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as he pulled out against the gale
he could see that even there had once been a seal nursery. And it was so in all
the other islands that he visited.
</p>
<p>
Limmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five seasons
exploring, with a four months’ rest each year at Novastoshnah, when the
holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary islands. He went to the
Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator, where he was nearly baked to
death; he went to the Georgia Islands, the Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little
Nightingale Island, Gough’s Island, Bouvet’s Island, the Crossets, and even to
a little speck of an island south of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the
People of the Sea told him the same things. Seals had come to those islands
once upon a time, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands
of miles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that was
when he was coming back from Gough’s Island), he found a few hundred mangy
seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.
</p>
<p>
That nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his own
beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of green trees,
where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick caught fish for him
and told him all his sorrows. “Now,” said Kotick, “I am going back to
Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens with the holluschickie I
shall not care.”
</p>
<p>
The old seal said, “Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of
Masafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand there was
a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come out of the North
and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old, and I shall never live to
see that day, but others will. Try once more.”
</p>
<p>
And Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, “I am the only
white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the only seal,
black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.”
</p>
<p>
This cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that summer,
Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for he was no longer a
holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly white mane on his
shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his father. “Give me another
season,” he said. “Remember, Mother, it is always the seventh wave that goes
farthest up the beach.”
</p>
<p>
Curiously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put off
marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with her all down
Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last exploration. This time
he went westward, because he had fallen on the trail of a great shoal of
halibut, and he needed at least one hundred pounds of fish a day to keep him in
good condition. He chased them till he was tired, and then he curled himself up
and went to sleep on the hollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper
Island. He knew the coast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt
himself gently bumped on a weed-bed, he said, “Hm, tide’s running strong
tonight,” and turning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched.
Then he jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal
water and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.
</p>
<p>
“By the Great Combers of Magellan!” he said, beneath his mustache. “Who in the
Deep Sea are these people?”
</p>
<p>
They were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish, squid, or
scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between twenty and thirty
feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a shovel-like tail that looked as
if it had been whittled out of wet leather. Their heads were the most
foolish-looking things you ever saw, and they balanced on the ends of their
tails in deep water when they weren’t grazing, bowing solemnly to each other
and waving their front flippers as a fat man waves his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Ahem!” said Kotick. “Good sport, gentlemen?” The big things answered by bowing
and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began feeding again
Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces that they could
twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with a whole bushel of
seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into their mouths and chumped
solemnly.
</p>
<p>
“Messy style of feeding, that,” said Kotick. They bowed again, and Kotick began
to lose his temper. “Very good,” he said. “If you do happen to have an extra
joint in your front flipper you needn’t show off so. I see you bow gracefully,
but I should like to know your names.” The split lips moved and twitched; and
the glassy green eyes stared, but they did not speak.
</p>
<p>
“Well!” said Kotick. “You’re the only people I’ve ever met uglier than Sea
Vitch—and with worse manners.”
</p>
<p>
Then he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed to him
when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled backward in the
water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.
</p>
<p>
The sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed, and
Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked up in his
travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as human beings. But
the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot talk. He has only six bones
in his neck where he ought to have seven, and they say under the sea that that
prevents him from speaking even to his companions. But, as you know, he has an
extra joint in his foreflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes
what answers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.
</p>
<p>
By daylight Kotick’s mane was standing on end and his temper was gone where the
dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very slowly, stopping
to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and Kotick followed them,
saying to himself, “People who are such idiots as these are would have been
killed long ago if they hadn’t found out some safe island. And what is good
enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for the Sea Catch. All the same, I wish
they’d hurry.”
</p>
<p>
It was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or fifty
miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the shore all the
time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and under them, but he could
not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went farther north they held a bowing
council every few hours, and Kotick nearly bit off his mustache with impatience
till he saw that they were following up a warm current of water, and then he
respected them more.
</p>
<p>
One night they sank through the shiny water—sank like stones—and for the first
time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick followed, and the
pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow was anything of a
swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore—a cliff that ran down into deep
water, and plunged into a dark hole at the foot of it, twenty fathoms under the
sea. It was a long, long swim, and Kotick badly wanted fresh air before he was
out of the dark tunnel they led him through.
</p>
<p>
“My wig!” he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at the
farther end. “It was a long dive, but it was worth it.”
</p>
<p>
The sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of the
finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long stretches of
smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make seal-nurseries, and
there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland behind them, and there were
rollers for seals to dance in, and long grass to roll in, and sand dunes to
climb up and down, and, best of all, Kotick knew by the feel of the water,
which never deceives a true sea catch, that no men had ever come there.
</p>
<p>
The first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good, and
then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low sandy islands
half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the northward, out to sea,
ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that would never let a ship come within
six miles of the beach, and between the islands and the mainland was a stretch
of deep water that ran up to the perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the
cliffs was the mouth of the tunnel.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,” said Kotick. “Sea Cow
must be wiser than I thought. Men can’t come down the cliffs, even if there
were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to splinters. If any
place in the sea is safe, this is it.”
</p>
<p>
He began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was in a
hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new country, so
that he would be able to answer all questions.
</p>
<p>
Then he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced through to
the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have dreamed of there being
such a place, and when he looked back at the cliffs even Kotick could hardly
believe that he had been under them.
</p>
<p>
He was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when he
hauled out just above Sea Lion’s Neck the first person he met was the seal who
had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes that he had found
his island at last.
</p>
<p>
But the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals
laughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young seal about
his own age said, “This is all very well, Kotick, but you can’t come from no
one knows where and order us off like this. Remember we’ve been fighting for
our nurseries, and that’s a thing you never did. You preferred prowling about
in the sea.”
</p>
<p>
The other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his head
from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a great fuss
about it.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve no nursery to fight for,” said Kotick. “I only want to show you all a
place where you will be safe. What’s the use of fighting?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you’re trying to back out, of course I’ve no more to say,” said the
young seal with an ugly chuckle.
</p>
<p>
“Will you come with me if I win?” said Kotick. And a green light came into his
eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.
</p>
<p>
“Very good,” said the young seal carelessly. “If you win, I’ll come.”
</p>
<p>
He had no time to change his mind, for Kotick’s head was out and his teeth sunk
in the blubber of the young seal’s neck. Then he threw himself back on his
haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook him, and knocked him over.
Then Kotick roared to the seals: “I’ve done my best for you these five seasons
past. I’ve found you the island where you’ll be safe, but unless your heads are
dragged off your silly necks you won’t believe. I’m going to teach you now.
Look out for yourselves!”
</p>
<p>
Limmershin told me that never in his life—and Limmershin sees ten thousand big
seals fighting every year—never in all his little life did he see anything like
Kotick’s charge into the nurseries. He flung himself at the biggest sea catch
he could find, caught him by the throat, choked him and bumped him and banged
him till he grunted for mercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next.
You see, Kotick had never fasted for four months as the big seals did every
year, and his deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best
of all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane stood up with rage,
and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was splendid to
look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past, hauling the grizzled
old seals about as though they had been halibut, and upsetting the young
bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave a roar and shouted: “He may be
a fool, but he is the best fighter on the beaches! Don’t tackle your father, my
son! He’s with you!”
</p>
<p>
Kotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache on end,
blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was going to marry
Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was a gorgeous fight, for
the two fought as long as there was a seal that dared lift up his head, and
when there were none they paraded grandly up and down the beach side by side,
bellowing.
</p>
<p>
At night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through the
fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered nurseries and
the torn and bleeding seals. “Now,” he said, “I’ve taught you your lesson.”
</p>
<p>
“My wig!” said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was fearfully
mauled. “The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up worse. Son, I’m
proud of you, and what’s more, I’ll come with you to your island—if there is
such a place.”
</p>
<p>
“Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow’s tunnel?
Answer, or I shall teach you again,” roared Kotick.
</p>
<p>
There was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the beaches. “We
will come,” said thousands of tired voices. “We will follow Kotick, the White
Seal.”
</p>
<p>
Then Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes proudly.
He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail. All the same he
would have scorned to look at or touch one of his wounds.
</p>
<p>
A week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old seals)
went away north to the Sea Cow’s tunnel, Kotick leading them, and the seals
that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next spring, when they all
met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick’s seals told such tales of the
new beaches beyond Sea Cow’s tunnel that more and more seals left Novastoshnah.
Of course it was not all done at once, for the seals are not very clever, and
they need a long time to turn things over in their minds, but year after year
more seals went away from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries,
to the quiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through,
getting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the holluschickie play
around him, in that sea where no man comes.
