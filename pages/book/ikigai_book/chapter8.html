      <p>GENTLE MOVEMENTS, LONGER LIFE</p>
    </h1>
    <h1 align="center">
      <p>Exercises from the East that
        promote health and longevity</p>
    </h1>

    <p style="font-size: 17px">STUDIES FROM THEBlue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who
      do the most exercise
      but rather the ones who move the most.</p>
    <p>When we visited Ogimi, the Village of Longevity, we discovered that even
      people over eighty and ninety years old are still highly active. They don't stay at
      home looking out the window or reading the newspaper. Ogimi's residents walk a
      lot, do karaoke with their neighbors, get up early in the morning, and, as soon as
      they've had breakfast—or even before—head outside to weed their gardens. They
      don't go to the gym or exercise intensely, but they almost never stop moving in
      the course of their daily routines.
    </p>
    <p class="highlight_section"><b>As Easy as Getting out of Your Chair</b><br>
      "Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The
      enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where
      it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol
      drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things
      going again. These things are so simple they're almost stupid," says Gavin
      Bradley

      in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.

      Bradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director
      of an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how
      detrimental sitting all the time can be to our health.
    </p>
    <p>If we live in a city, we might find it hard to move in natural and healthy ways
      every day, but we can turn to exercises that have proven for centuries to be good
      for the body.</p>
    <p>The Eastern disciplines for bringing body, mind, and soul into balance have
      become quite popular in the West, but in their countries of origin they have been
      used for ages to promote health.
    </p>
    <p>Yoga—originally from India, though very popular in Japan—and China's
      qigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a
      person's body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and
      serenity.
    </p>
    <p>They are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.
    </p>
    <p>These gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits, and are particularly
      appropriate for older individuals who have a harder time staying fit.</p>
    <p>Tai chi has been shown, among other things, to slow the development of
      osteoporosis and Parkinson's disease, to increase circulation, and to improve
      muscle tone and flexibility. Its emotional benefits are just as important: It is a
      great shield against stress and depression.</p>
    <p>You don't need to go to the gym for an hour every day or run marathons. As
      Japanese centenarians show us, all you need is to add movement to your day.
      Practicing any of these Eastern disciplines on a regular basis is a great way to do
      so. An added benefit is that they all have well-defined steps, and as we saw in
      chapter IV, disciplines with clear rules are good for flow. If you don't like any of
      these disciplines, feel free to choose a practice that you love and that makes you
      move.</p>
    <p>In the following pages we'll take a look at some of the practices that promote
      health and longevity—but first, a little appetizer: a singularly Japanese exercise
      for starting your day.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <p>Radio taiso</p>
    </h3>
    <p>This morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The "radio"
      part of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted
      over the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a
      television channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps.</p>
    <p>One of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity
      among participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools
      before the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins.</p>
    <p>Statistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few
      minutes every morning, but radio taiso is one thing that almost everyone we
      interviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we
      visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the
      exercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we
      felt refreshed for the rest of the day.</p>
    <p>When these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a
      large reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker.
      The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or
      only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint
      mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising
      mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising
      your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It
      is a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity
      and that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible.
    </p>
    <p>It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without
      raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using
      computers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times
      we raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard
      or closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the
      time when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the
      basic movements of the body.

    <h3>
      <p>Yoga</p>
    </h3>
    <p>Popular in Japan as well as in the West, yoga can be done by almost anyone.
      Some of its poses have even been adapted for pregnant women and practitioners
      with physical disabilities.
    </p>
    <p>Yoga comes from India, where it was developed millennia ago to unite our
      mental and physical elements. The word yoga itself comes from the Sanskrit term
      for "yoke," which refers to the crosspiece that binds draft animals to one another
      and to the cart they're pulling. Yoga strives to unite body and mind in the same
      way, guiding us toward a healthy lifestyle in harmony with the world around us.
      <br> The main objectives of yoga are:
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
        <p>To bring us closer to our (human) nature</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mental and physical purification</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To bring us closer to the divine</p>
      </li>

    </ul>
    <h4>
      <p>Styles of yoga</p>
    </h4>
    <p>Though all are oriented toward similar goals, there are many different types of
      yoga that vary according to the traditions and texts from which they were
      developed. The differences among them lie, as the masters say, in the path taken
      to the summit of our best self.
    </p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
        <p>Jnana yoga: the yoga of wisdom; the search for discipline and mental
          growth</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Karma yoga: focuses on action, on tasks and duties that benefit oneself and
          one's community</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bhakti yoga: the yoga of devotion and surrender to the divine</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mantra yoga: focuses on the recitation of mantras to reach a state of
          relaxation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Kundalini yoga: combines diverse steps to reach the desired mental state</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Raja yoga: also known as the royal path; encompasses a range of steps
          geared toward achieving communion with oneself and others</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hatha yoga: the most widespread form in the West and Japan; characterized
          by asanas or poses combined in a quest for balance</p>
      </li>

    </ul>
    <h3>
      <p>How to do a Sun Salutation</p>
    </h3>
    <p>The Sun Salutation is one of the most iconic exercises in hatha yoga. To do it, you
      simply have to follow these twelve basic movements:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>With your feet together, stand up straight but keep your muscles relaxed.
          Exhale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Place the palms of your hands together in front of your chest; from this
          position, inhale as you raise your arms above your head and bend backward
          slightly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Exhale as you bend forward until you touch the ground with the palms of
          your hands, without bending your knees</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stretch one leg back to touch the floor with the tips of your toes. Inhale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring the other leg back, keeping your legs and arms straight, as you hold
          your breath.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As you exhale, bend your arms and bring your chest to the ground and then
          forward, resting your knees on the ground.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Straighten your arms and bend your spine back, keeping the lower half of
          your body on the ground. Inhale</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>With your hands and feet on the ground, lift your hips until your arms and
          legs are straight and your body forms an upside-down V. Exhale throughout
          the movement.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring forward the same leg you'd stretched back earlier and bend it so that
          your knee and foot are aligned under your head and between your hands.
          Inhale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Exhale as you bring your back foot forward and straighten your legs, keeping
          your hands on the ground as in posture 3</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring your arms above your head with your palms together and bend
          backward slightly, as you did in posture 2, while you inhale.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lower your arms to their initial position in mountain pose while you exhale.</p>
      </li>

    </ol>
    <p>You've just greeted the sun; now you're ready to have a fantastic day.</p>

    <h3>
      <p>Tai chi</p>
    </h3>
    <p>Also known as t'ai chi ch'uan (or taijiquan), tai chi is a Chinese martial art that
      can be traced back hundreds of years to Buddhism and Confucianism; it is very
      popular in Japan, too.
    </p>
    <p>According to Chinese tradition, it was created by the Taoist master and martial
      arts practitioner Zhang Sanfeng, though it was Yang Luchan who in the
      nineteenth century brought the form to the rest of the world.</p>
    <p>Tai chi was originally a neijia, or internal martial art, meaning its goal was
      personal growth. Focused on self-defense, it teaches those who practice it to
      defeat their adversaries by using the least amount of force possible and by relying
      on agility</p>
    <p>Tai chi, which was also seen as a means of healing body and mind, would go
      on to be used more frequently to foster health and inner peace. To encourage its
      citizens to be more active, the Chinese government promoted it as an exercise,
      and it lost its original connection to martial arts, becoming instead a source of
      health and well-being accessible to all.
    </p>
    <h4>
      <p>Styles of tai chi</p>
    </h4>
    <p>There are different schools and styles of tai chi. The following are the best
      known:</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>
        <p>Chen-style: alternates between slow movements and explosive ones</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Yang-style: the most widespread of the forms; characterized by slow, fluid
          movements</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Wu-style: utilizes small, slow, deliberate movements</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Hao-style: centered on internal movements, with almost microscopic
          external movements; one of the least practiced forms of tai chi, even in
          China</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite their differences, these styles all have the same objectives:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>To control movement through stillness</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To overcome force through finesse</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To move second and arrive first</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>To know yourself and your opponent</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      <p>The ten basic principles of tai chi</p>
    </h4>
    <p>According to the master Yang Chengfu, the correct practice of tai chi follows ten
      basic principles:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Elevate the crown of your head, and focus all your energy there.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tighten your chest and expand your back to lighten your lower body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Relax your waist and let it guide your body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Learn to differentiate between heaviness and lightness, knowing how your
          weight is distributed.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Relax the shoulders to allow free movement of the arms and promote the
          flow of energy.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Value the agility of the mind over the strength of the body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Unify the upper and lower body so they act in concert.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Unify the internal and the external to synchronize mind, body, and breath.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Do not break the flow of your movement; maintain fluidity and harmony.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Look for stillness in movement. An active body leads to a calm mind.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      <p>Imitating clouds</p>
    </h4>
    <p>One of the best-known movements in tai chi consists of following the form of
      clouds in an exercise called Wave Hands Like Clouds. Here are the steps:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Extend your arms in front of you with your palms down.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn your palms to face in, as though you were hugging a tree trunk.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Open your arms out to the side.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring the left arm up and center, and the right arm down and center</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Trace the shape of a ball in front of your body.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Turn your left palm toward your face.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Shift your weight to your left foot and pivot from your hip toward that side,
          while your eyes follow the movement of your hand.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Bring your left hand to your waist and your right hand in front of your face</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Shift your weight to your right foot.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pivot toward your right, looking at your raised right hand the entire time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Repeat this movement fluidly, shifting your weight from one foot to the
          other as you reposition your hands.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Stretch your arms out in front of you again and bring them down slowly,
          returning to your initial position.</p>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h3>
      <p>Qigong</p>
    </h3>
    <p>Also known as chi kung, its name combines qi (life force, or energy) and gong
      (work), indicating that the form works with the individual's life force. Though
      relatively modern, especially under its current name, the art of qigong is based on
      the Tao yin, an ancient art meant to foster mental and physical well-being.
    </p>
    <p>The practice began to appear in reports on training and martial arts at the
      beginning of the twentieth century, and by the 1930s was being used in hospitals.
      The Chinese government later popularized it, as it had done with tai chi.</p>
    <p>Qigong involves static and dynamic physical exercises that stimulate
      respiration in a standing, seated, or reclined position. There are many different
      styles of qigong, but all of them seek to strengthen and regenerate qi. Though its
      movements are typically gentle, the practice is intense.</p>
    <h4>
      <p>Benefits of qigong</p>
    </h4>
    <p>According to numerous international scientific studies, qigong—like tai chi and
      yoga—offers significant health benefits. The following stand out among those
      proven through scientific research, as observed by Dr. Kenneth M. Sancier of San
      Francisco's Qigong Institute in his article "Medical Applications of Qigong"

      :</p>
    <ul type="square">

      <p>Methods for practicing qigong</p>
    </h4>
    <p>In order to practice qigong correctly, we should remember that our life energy
      flows through our whole body. We should know how to regulate its many parts:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>Tyau Shenn: (regulating the body) by adopting the correct posture—it is
          important to be firmly rooted to the ground</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tyau Shyi: (regulating the breath) until it is calm, steady, and peaceful</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tyau Hsin: (regulating the mind); the most complicated part, as it implies
          emptying the mind of thoughts</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tyau Chi: (regulating the life force) through the regulation of the three prior
          elements, so that it flows naturally</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Tyau Shen: (regulating the spirit); the spirit is both strength and root in battle,
          as Yang Jwing-Ming explains in The Essence of Taiji Qigong.
          4</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>In this way, the whole organism will be prepared to work together toward a
      single goal.</p>
    <h4>
      <p>The five elements of qigong</p>
    </h4>
    <p>One of qigong's best-known exercises is a series representing the five elements:
      earth, water, wood, metal, and fire. This series of movements seeks to balance the
      five currents of energy in order to improve brain and organ function.
      There are several ways to do these movements. In this case, we're following
      the model of Professor María Isabel García Monreal from the Qigong Institute in
      Barcelona.

        <p>Turn your feet outward slightly to strengthen the posture.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Keep your shoulders relaxed and down and your arms loose at your sides,
          slightly away from your body (this is the Wu Qi, or rooted, posture)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As you inhale, raise your arms in front of you until your hands are level with
          your shoulders, your palms facing down</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Exhale as you bend your knees and bring your arms down until your hands

      <p>Shiatsu</p>
    </h3>
    <p>Created in Japan in the early twentieth century, principally for the treatment of
      arthritis, shiatsu also works on energy flow through the application of pressure
      with the thumbs and the palms of the hands. In combination with stretching and
      breathing exercises, it seeks to create equilibrium among the different elements
      of the body</p>
    <p style="background-color:rgb(254, 248, 248) ">It is not important that a Tao Yin* have a name, is imitating
      something, or is
      engraved in jade. What is important is the technique and the essence of
      what is really practiced. Stretching and contracting, bending and lifting of
      the head, stepping, lying down, resting or standing, walking or stepping
      slowly, screaming or breathing—everything can be a Tao Yin.

    <h3>
      <p>Breathe better, live longer</p>
    </h3>
    <p>The book Xiuzhen shishu, known in the West as Ten Books on the Cultivation of
      Perfection, dates back to the thirteenth century and is a compendium of materials
      from diverse sources on developing the mind and body.</p>
    <p>It quotes, among others, the celebrated Chinese doctor and essayist Sun
      Simiao, who lived during the sixth century. Sun Simiao was a proponent of a
      technique called the Six Healing Sounds, which involves the coordination of
      movement, breathing, and pronouncing sounds with the purpose of bringing our
      souls to a place of calm.</p>
    <p>The six sounds are:</p>
    <p>Xu, pronounced like "shh" with a deep sigh, which is associated with the liver
      <br>He, pronounced like "her" with a yawn, which is associated with the heart
      <br>Si, pronounced like "sir" with a slow exhale, which is associated with the lungs
      <br>Chui, pronounced like "chwee" with a forceful exhale, which is associated
      with the kidneys
      <br> Hoo, pronounced like "who," which is associated with the spleen
      <br>Xi, pronounced like "she," which connects the whole body
    </p>
    <p>The following poem by Sun Simiao offers clues about how to live well
      according to the season. It reminds us of the importance of breathing, and
      suggests that as we breathe, we visualize the organs associated with each of the
      healing sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spring, breathe xu for clear eyes and so wood can aid your liver.<br>
      In summer, reach for he, so that heart and fire can be at peace.
      <br>In fall, breathe si to stabilize and gather metal, keeping the lungs moist.
      <br>For the kidneys, next, breathe chui and see your inner waters calm.
      <br>The Triple Heater needs your xi to expel all heat and troubles.
      <br>In all four seasons, take deep breaths so your spleen can process food.
      <br>And, of course, avoid exhaling noisily; don't let even your own ears hear you.
      <br>The practice is most excellent and will help preserve your divine elixir.
    </p>
    <p>It might feel confusing to be presented with all the Eastern traditions we have
      introduced in this chapter. The takeaway is that they all combine a physical
      exercise with an awareness of our breath. These two components—movement
      and breath—help us to bring our consciousness in line with our body, instead of
      allowing our mind to be carried away by the sea of daily worries. Most of the
      time, we are just not aware enough of our breathing.</p>
