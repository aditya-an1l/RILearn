    <p>WELL, now that Ram Bharosa has the blue umbrella—a gift from
Binya, as he tells everyone—he is sometimes persuaded to go out
into the sun or the rain, and as a result he looks much healthier.
Sometimes he uses the umbrella to chase away pigs or goats. It is always
left open outside the shop, and anyone who wants to borrow it may do so;
and so in a way it has become everyone’s umbrella. It is faded and patchy,
but it is still the best umbrella in the village.</p>
<p>People are visiting Ram Bharosa’s shop again. Whenever Bijju or Binya
stop for a cup of tea, he gives them a little extra milk or sugar. They like
their tea sweet and milky.
</p>
<p>A few nights ago, a bear visited Ram Bharosa’s shop. There had been
snow on the higher ranges of the Himalayas, and the bear had been finding
it difficult to obtain food; so it had come lower down, to see what it could
pick up near the village. That night it scrambled on to the tin roof of Ram
Bharosa’s shop, and made off with a huge pumpkin which had been
ripening on the roof. But in climbing off the roof, the bear had lost a claw.</p>
<p>Next morning Ram Bharosa found the claw just outside the door of his
shop. He picked it up and put it in his pocket. A bear’s claw was a lucky
find.</p>
<p>A day later, when he went into the market-town, he took the claw with
him, and left it with a silversmith, giving the craftsman certain instructions.</p>
<p>The silversmith made a locket for the claw; then he gave it a thin silver
chain. When Ram Bharosa came again, he paid the silversmith ten rupees
for his work.
</p>
<p>The days were growing shorter, and Binya had to be home a little earlier
every evening. There was a hungry leopard at large, and she couldn’t leave
the cows out after dark.
</p>
<p>She was hurrying past Ram Bharosa’s shop when the old man called out
to her.
</p>
<p>“Binya, spare a minute! i want to show you something.”</p>
<p>Binya stepped into the shop.</p>
<p>“What do you think of it?” asked Ram Bharosa, showing her the silver
pendant with the claw.
</p>
<p>“It’s so beautiful,” said Binya, just touching the claw and the silver
chain.
</p>
<p>“It’s a bear’s claw,” said Ram Bharosa. “That’s even luckier than a
leopard’s claw. Would you like to have it?”
</p>
<p>“I have no money,” said Binya.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. You gave me the umbrella—i give you the claw!
Come, let’s see what it looks like on you.”
</p>
<p>He placed the pendant on Binya, and indeed it looked very beautiful on
her.</p>
<p>Ram Bharosa says he will never forget the smile she gave him when she
left the shop.
</p>
<p>She was halfway home when she realized she had left the cows behind.</p>
<p>“Neelu, Neelu!” she called. “Oh, Gori!”
</p>
<p>There was a faint tinkle of bells as the cows came slowly down the
mountain path.
</p>
<p>In the distance she could hear her mother and Bijju calling for her.
She began to sing. They heard her singing, and knew she was safe and
near</p>
<p>She walked home through the darkening glade, singing of the stars; and
the trees stood still and listened to her, and the mountains were glad.</p>
