    <p>
      This is a true story. I heard it on the radio during one of my visits to the US. It
      happened in one of the biggest cities in the world, New York.</p>

    <p>It was winter. One evening, a worried mother stood shivering by the road,
      wearing an old coat. With her was a little girl, thin, sick-looking with a
      shaven head. She was wearing an oversize dress which somebody had
      probably given to her out of mercy. It was apparent that they were homeless
      and poor. The child had a cardboard placard in her hand which said, ‘I am
      suffering from cancer. Please help me.’</p>

    <p>The mother was carrying a begging bowl. Whenever the traffic lights
      turned red they would approach people, stopping them on the road and asking
      for help.</p>

    <p>America is a rich country, but if you are sick and don’t have insurance, then
      you are lost. Nobody can support you. People give small amounts of money
      when they see such pleas for help. This kind of a scene is not uncommon in
      India. We see lots of beggars with small infants in one hand and a begging
      bowl in another. But in America it is not so common. People felt bad for this
      unfortunate mother and child.</p>

    <p>One day, a policeman was passing by and saw them. He asked them a few
      questions and noticed that the child indeed looked very sick with her swollen
      eyes and shaven head. He wanted to help, so he opened his purse. He saw a
      bundle of notes which he had just drawn from the bank. He had received a
      good bonus for the excellent work he had done. He thought, ‘I have a warm
      home, a caring wife and a loving son. God has been very kind to me. But
      these unfortunate people don’t have any one of these things. It is not their
      mistake that God has not been kind to them.’ He remembered the many things
      he had promised his wife and son he would buy when he got his bonus. For a
      while he was in two minds. Then he decided and gave all the cash which he
      had drawn from the bank to the woman and said, ‘Please take good care
      of the child.’</p>

    <p> When he reached home his son met him at the doorstep as usual and
      hugged him. The house was warm and nice. He sat in front of his wife, and
      looking at the snow falling outside, he narrated the whole incident. After
      listening to him for a while his wife was silent, then she smiled. But the son
      was angry. He said, ‘Dad, how are you sure that they have not cheated you?
      And even though you wanted to give some money you could have given some
      portion. Why did you give everything?’</p>

    <p>The policeman laughed at his son and said, ‘Son, you do not know what
      poverty is. I come across such unfortunate people in my work.’</p>

    <p>The days passed and everybody forgot about it.
      One day a news item in the paper caught the son’s attention: ‘Mother and
      child caught cheating.’ With great interest he read:</p>

    <p>‘A greedy mother used her healthy child to pose as a cancer patient. She
      shaved the child’s head, starved her and dressed her shabbily so that anybody
      would feel the child was suffering from cancer. Using this tactic she duped
      many people. The mother has been arrested.’</p>

    <p> The son realized who these people were and was very upset. When his
      father came home, he told him as soon as he entered the house, ‘Dad, you
      were cheated by that lady and her child who you thought was a cancer patient.
      The child is healthy and you gave away your entire bonus to that child.’</p>

    <p>His father did not reply. He sat down, and looked out of the window. There
      were children playing outside. Winter was over and summer was setting in. In
      a calm voice he said, ‘Son, I am very happy. The child is healthy.’</p>

    <p>The boy was surprised. He thought being a policeman, his father would
      pick up the phone and talk to the police station or he would be depressed that
      he had been cheated and given away so much of money to a healthy child.
      But there were no traces of such emotions.,/p>

    <p>He asked, ‘Dad, tell me, are you not upset?’</p>
    <p>His father again gave him the same answer, ‘I am happy that the child is
      healthy.’</p>

    <p> By that time his wife came with a mug of coffee in her hand. She had heard
      the entire conversation. With happiness in her voice she told her son. ‘Son,
      you are very fortunate. You have an extraordinary father, who is not angry
      even though he has lost a lot of money. You should be proud that your father
      is happy thinking somebody’s child is healthy, rather than worrying about his
      own big bonus. Learn from him. Help people without expecting anything in
      return.’</p>
