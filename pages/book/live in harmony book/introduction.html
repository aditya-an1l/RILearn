      <p>Introduction</p>
    </h1>
    <p> Living in Harmony is intended to provide a pathway for students and
 teachers towards the goals of fostering greater harmony in their schools, in their
 communities and in the world. There are two primary aspects of our experience as
 human beings – an inner, personal, and individual aspect; and an outer, social and
 communal aspect. In order to build a world of greater harmony, we must first
 establish some measure of harmony in our own personality. Then we must learn
 the skills of creating harmony in our relationships with others. With a sense of
 harmony within ourselves, combined with the tools necessary to create harmo
nious relationships with others, we have the resources with which to build harmo
nious communities – both local and global.</p>

<p> Living in Harmony focuses on these aspects of human development.  The
 inner aspect is addressed in Part I and the outer aspect is the focus of Part II.  In
 Part I, we explore ten ways for students to get in touch with their own inner world– that is, with their own feelings, thoughts, and dreams.  The first and primary
 relationship we have is with ourselves.  It is on this relationship that all of our
 other relationships hinge.  Children who are balanced, confident, sensitive indi
viduals with a healthy self-image are more likely to have positive and productive
 relationships with others.  Their ability to accept who they are, to appreciate their
 own talents, and to express their feelings and ideas in constructive ways will
 directly affect their capacity to be caring, understanding, and communicative part
ners with others
</p>
<p>  The first ten chapters of this book present a broad spectrum of activities
 designed to help foster and guide this inner aspect of development. Studying the
 curriculum of the inner life is different from studying math, reading, geography or
 science.  When we teach ‘normal’ academic subjects, we look to books and to the
 world around us.  To help students study the subject of their inner world, we turn
 their attention to their feelings, ideas, dreams and visions.  To study academic
 subjects, we encourage students to use their minds, and the aim is to gain knowl
edge and skills.  To study the inner life, we must help students make a connection
 to their own private selves - their hearts and souls. The aim here is to help them
 gain wisdom, peace, and the development of their nobler qualities. The ‘inner’
 curriculum is about helping students become more aligned with their own source,
 in order that they may attain greater happiness and be of better service to the
 world.
 
</p>
<p>The second ten chapters of the book help teachers and students move from
 the realm of the personal to the realm of society. These chapters are aimed at
building what Riane Eisler would call partnership skills - that is, skills in building
 relationships based upon mutual trust, respect, and communication.  The relation
ships built by means of partnership skills are ones undertaken with a clear under
standing of the common benefits working together can bring.  Some partnership
 skills have to do with helping students gain a better understanding of the geogra
phy and the history of the world, so that they are able to begin to place their own
 culture, perspectives and opinions into a broader global context.  Other partner
ship skills, such as cooperation skills and conflict resolution skills, focus on help
ing students learn to weave the fabric of relationships – communication – into
 productive results. Still other partnership skills have to do with helping students
 develop their inborn human capacity for caring, compassion, and empathy.  All
 of these partnership skills comprise the larger building blocks of leadership qual
ities that students can develop with the ultimate purpose of building a peaceful
 and just society on earth. 
</p>
<p>The language of Living in Harmony is directed at students.  In other words,
 it is written to bypass the need of the teacher to interpret the lessons and to put
 them into child-oriented language.  It is intended to be less like an instructional
 manual for teachers and more like a storybook.  The teacher of students in grades
 1-3 can simply read the book aloud to the students.  Students in grades 4-6 can
 read some sections silently, but they will benefit from reading aloud to each other,
 or teachers of students in these grades can read the entire book aloud to the stu
dents.  Students in grades 7 and 8 can read some sections silently on their own,
 read other sections aloud to each other, or they can occasionally read sections to
 younger students.  </p>
<p>ger students.  
The chapter lessons are intended to appeal to a wide variety of learners.
 The activities are designed to appeal to different interests and to involve many
 learning modes – imagination, creativity, mind-body fitness, language, nature, etc.
 There is a wide enough variety of activities to suit all kinds of learners.  By
 exposing children to a full spectrum of activities, we enhance their holistic devel
opment into healthy, balanced, insightful, happy, and confident young adults. The
 language, and the topics covered, lend themselves to many opportunities for addi
tional spelling, vocabulary, writing, reading, and artistic activities that could be
 created by the teacher and the students – if they have the space in their curriculum</p>
<p> “The language of the heart is the only language that everybody can under
stand,” as Sri Chinmoy says. The ultimate goal of this book is to put students in
 touch with their own hearts, so that they can ultimately express their nobler quali
ties and develop their unique talents for the greater good of the world at large.
 The world desperately needs a new generation of leaders who understand and
 speak the language of the heart.  It is hoped that this book will facilitate the stu
dents’ journey to their own highest and best selves, and from there outward
 towards the communities they will be charged with constructing as future leaders Riane Eisler has said, “"I see a world where the most highly valued work will
 have the consciousness of caring."  It is hoped that Living in Harmony will help
 students, teachers, and parents alike to move forward towards the fulfillment of
 that vision.
 
</p>
<p> I want to thank Sri Chinmoy for all of his work for world harmony and for
 inspiring the writing of this book.  I want also to thank Riane Eisler for being a
 source of spiritual light and wisdom.  Thanks to all of my colleagues - especially
 Tim Seldin, Jonathan Wolff, Margaret Wolff, Paul Epstein, Ann Epstein and Aline
 Wolf for their tireless support and encouragement. Thank you to dear friends, Zoe
 Handerson, June Lang, Stefania Rubino and Sahayak Plowman for their invalu
able contributions. I also want to thank Paula Kleinman for her invaluable help in
 editing this book. Finally, thank you to all the students, fellow teachers, and par
ents throughout the years from whom I have gained insights, ideas, and inspira
tion in ways great and small
