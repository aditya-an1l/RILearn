      <p>Chapter Two</p>
      <p> Imagination</p>
    </h1>
    <p class="side"> Chapter Inspiration:</p>
<p>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagina
tion encircles the world.” –Albert Einstein
</p>
<p>“Formulate and stamp indelibly on your mind a mental picture of yourself as suc
ceeding. Hold this picture tenaciously.  Never permit it to fade. Your mind will
 seek to develop the picture... do not build up obstacles in your imagination.”–Norman Vincent Peale
</p>
<p> “There is only one admirable form of the imagination: the imagination that is so
 intense that it creates a new reality, that it makes things happen.” – Sean O’Faolain
</p>
<p> “Imagination is the beginning of creation, you imagine what you desire, you will
 what you imagine and at last you create what you will.” – George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p> “An idea is salvation by imagination.” –Frank Lloyd Wright</p>
<p> “You cannot depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.” – Mark Twai
</p>
<p> “Imagine the beauty of an earth without tears.
 Imagine a world with happy smiling faces.” –Sri Chinmoy
</p>
<p> “I am certain of nothing but the holiness of the heart’s affections and the truth of
 imagination.  What the imagination seizes as beauty must be truth – whether it
 existed before or not.” –John Keats
</p>
<p> “Imagination rules the world.”  —Napoleon I</p>
<p> “Imagination grows by exercise.”  —Somerset Maugham
</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Story:
</p>
<p> Once there was a young boy who grew up on a farm.  The boy used to lie
 in his bed at night and be very still.  In the peaceful silence he would see himself
 shooting a basketball and he would picture it swishing through the net over and
 over again. He imagined himself in different places on the basketball court and
 how he would shoot the ball from each place.  Each time, he imagined the ball
 going smoothly and perfectly through the hoop.  He used his imagination to visu
alize or ‘see’ how his hands were holding the ball, how he was preparing the ball,
 and then how he would let go of the ball.   He even imagined how his arm and
 fingers would stay outstretched after the ball was released.  
</p>
<p>Then he would imagine himself in different situations during a basketball
 game.  In each situation he would use his imagination to see how he would shoot
 the ball in that situation.  One of his favorite situations to imagine was that it was
 at the very end of the game and there was only time for one last shot.  The boy
 visualized himself shooting the final shot and of course, in his imagination, the
 shot was a perfect swish through the basket to win the game! Thousands of times
 the boy would imagine playing basketball in this way.</p>
<p>This boy’s name was Larry Bird and he became one of the greatest basket
ball players in the history of this sport.  Of course the skill he was most famous
 for was shooting the ball.  Larry Bird was one of the best basketball shooters ever. </p>
<p class="side">Chapter Overview:</p>
<p>Imagination can be a very powerful and helpful force.  People use the
 word ‘imagination’ quite often, but how do we define imagination?  One way to
 think of it is that it is to see something that doesn’t exist yet, but that will exist or
 can exist.  For example, you can imagine what it might be like on your summer
 vacation when you go to the beach.  In your mind you can ‘see’ the water, smell
 the salt, and feel the sand under your feet.  This way of experiencing things in
 your mind we can call visualizing.  We can also call it seeing with your ‘mind’s
 eye.’ Or we can simply call this using our imagination.  In the chapter story,
 Larry Bird used his imagination very well to see himself shooting a basketball
 and being successful as a basketball player.  We can use our imagination for many
 kinds of things.  Imagination can help us accomplish whatever goals we have.
 Imagination can help us to reach for our dreams.  Imagination can also help us
 solve problems.</p>
<p class="side">Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #1 — The invisible heart </p>
<p>Imagine that you have a special place inside you, in the middle of your
 chest.  It is a place that is very peaceful and full of love.  We can call it our heart,
 but it is not the physical heart that is beating and pumping blood through our bod
ies. Let’s call it our ‘invisible heart,’ because when we love someone, we say that
 the feeling comes from our heart, even though we cannot see that heart.  Your
 invisible heart is a magical place where you can go.  It is a place where you can
 feel that you are connected with the whole world – people, animals, plants, even
 mountains.  Close your eyes for a minute or two and see if you can feel your
 invisible heart.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #2 – The flower inside your invisible heart</p>
<p>Now imagine you have a beautiful flower inside your invisible heart.  At
 first, the flower is just a bud, but then, petal by petal, it starts to unfold.  It begins
 to spread out and you can see its color.  You can even start to smell its fragrance.
 That flower is full of goodness and sweetness. Imagine that it grows in your
 invisible heart and that it is always there if you want to see it and feel it.  This
 special flower is like the best part of you.  It can remind you of what a special
 person you are.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #3 – Expanding and becoming light 
</p>
<p>Close your eyes and imagine you are looking up at the sky. Maybe it is a
 blue sky with white clouds, or maybe it is a night sky full of stars.  Imagine any
 kind of sky you wish and that you are looking up at it.  Maybe you are standing
 on a mountaintop or lying on your back in a meadow or at the beach.  See how
 big the sky is.  It goes on forever and ever.  We can’t know how big the sky is
 because nobody has seen the end of space.  Now as you breathe in imagine you
 are expanding and becoming light and floating upward.  You keep growing and
 expanding, becoming lighter and lighter, until you are as light as the air. Finally
 imagine you are as big and wide as the sky itself. How does it feel to be as large
 and as light as the sky?  Stay as big as the sky for as long as you like, and then let
 yourself shrink slowly back down to your regular size.  Now you are back where
 you were looking up at the sky.  Let yourself rest for a few moments and then
 open your eyes.</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #4  — Your own special place 
</p>
<p>Imagine you are going on a journey to a most special place.  Maybe it is in
 a forest, a jungle, the seaside, in a meadow, inside a cave, under the earth, beneath
 the sea, or even on another planet. Imagine you are walking through this special
 place.  What do you see?  Are there any special smells or sounds?  How does it
 feel in your special place?  Now imagine you find a special object.  Maybe it is a
 stone, a shell, a crystal, a special stick or anything else you want.   What is spe
cial about this object?  Does it have a special shape or color?  You can pick it up
 if you want to or just leave it where it is.  </p>
<p>Now imagine you meet a special friend.  It could be an animal, a tree, a
 fairy, an elf, a wizard, a warrior, or any other creature.  What does your friend
 look like?  Does your friend have anything to say to you or to show to you?  Stay
 with your friend as long as you want, and when you are ready open up your eyes.  
</p>
<p class="side">Lesson #5 – Joy
</p>
<p> Imagine yourself doing your favorite thing.  Is it ballet or soccer, karate or
 skiing?  See yourself doing your favorite activity.  How do you feel when you are
 doing your favorite thing?  Now imagine doing your very best performance.  Try
 to visualize exactly the moves or actions you have to do in order to do your best.
 Pay attention in your mind to the little details of how the different parts of your
 body are moving. Imagine that your body and your mind are working in harmony.
 Imagine that everything is flowing smoothly and easily; that everything is hap
pening almost by itself, with very little effort.  Imagine you are full of happiness
 because everything is happening as it should.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #6 – The future
</p>
<p> Imagine yourself in the future. What would you like to do? What will you
 become?  Imagine yourself as an adult being happy and successful.  Imagine that
 as an adult you are becoming absolutely the best person you can be.  What is spe
cial about the person you want to be?  Try to visualize what your best self looks
 like on the outside.  How does your best self feel on the inside?
</p>
<p class="side"> Discussion Questions:
</p>
<p> a) What do you think Albert Einstein meant when he said, “Imagination is more
 important than knowledge”?</p>
<p> b) Can you think of some of the things that would not exist if someone did not
imagine them first?  There are quite a few.  You can make a list of them!
</p>
<p> c) What are the three most important things you would like to accomplish when
 you become an adult, things that would make you feel happy and successful?</p>
<p> d) What are the three best qualities about you?  Make a list of them.  Then draw a
 picture or write a poem about one of them.
</p>
<p class="side"> Supplemental Activities:</p>
<ul>
    <li> <p>  You can try practicing lesson #5 right before practice, performance or game.
 Then practice it again one other time during the day, maybe before you go to
 sleep.  Keep a journal in which you write at least three times a week for a month.
 Write about your imagination practice and how it might change your experience
 of your performance of your favorite activity.</p></li>
<li>  <p> For any of the lessons #1-6 you can draw a picture or write about what you saw
 during the imagination activities. You can share these with the rest of your class
 and display them on the wall or on the bulletin board.</p></li>
<li> <p> Your invisible heart is where you keep many happy feelings.  Sometimes
 though you might feel sad. This happens to everyone.  What do you sometimes
 feel sad about?  Share with the class if you want to.  When you are sad you can
 use your imagination to make yourself feel better.  You can imagine your favorite
 things, imagine something that makes you happy, or imagine just being inside
 your invisible heart.  You can practice any of the lessons in this chapter to help
 yourself to feel happy and peaceful again.</p></li>
