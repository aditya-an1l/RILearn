      <p>The Night the Roof Blew Off</p>
    </h1>
    <p>We are used to sudden storms, up here on the first range of the Himalayas. The old
building in which we live has, for more than a hundred years, received the full
force of the wind as it sweeps across the hills from the east.
</p>
<p>We‚Äôd lived in the building for more than ten years without a disaster. It had even
taken the shock of a severe earthquake. As my granddaughter Dolly said, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs difficult
to tell the new cracks from the old!‚Äô</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a two-storey building, and I live on the upper floor with my family: my three
grandchildren and their parents. The roof is made of corrugated tin sheets, the ceiling of
wooden boards. That‚Äôs the traditional Mussoorie roof.</p>
<p>Looking back at the experience, it was the sort of thing that should have happened in
a James Thurber story, like the dam that burst or the ghost who got in. But I wasn‚Äôt
thinking of Thurber at the time, although a few of his books were among the many I was
trying to save from the icy rain pouring into my bedroom.</p>
<p>Our roof had held fast in many a storm, but the wind that night was really fierce. It
came rushing at us with a high-pitched, eerie wail. The old roof groaned and protested.
It took a battering for several hours while the rain lashed against the windows and the
lights kept coming and going.</p>
<p>There was no question of sleeping, but we remained in bed for warmth and comfort.
The fire had long since gone out, as the chimney had collapsed, bringing down a
shower of sooty rainwater</p>
<p>After about four hours of buffeting, the roof could take it no longer. My bedroom
faces east, so my portion of the roof was the first to go.
</p>
<p>The wind got under it and kept pushing until, with a ripping, groaning sound, the
metal sheets shifted and slid off the rafters, some of them dropping with claps like
thunder on to the road below.</p>
<p>So that‚Äôs it, I thought. Nothing worse can happen. As long as the ceiling stays on, I‚Äôm
not getting out of bed. We‚Äôll collect our roof in the morning.
</p>
<p>Icy water splashing down on my face made me change my mind in a hurry. Leaping
from the bed, I found that much of the ceiling had gone, too. Water was pouring on my
open typewriter as well as on the bedside radio and bed cover.</p>
<p>Picking up my precious typewriter (my companion for forty years) I stumbled into
the front sitting room (and library), only to find a similar situation there. Water was
pouring through the slats of the wooden ceiling, raining down on the open bookshelves.</p>
<p>By now I had been joined by the children, who had come to my rescue. Their section
of the roof hadn‚Äôt gone as yet. Their parents were struggling to close a window against
the driving rain.
</p>
<p>‚ÄòSave the books!‚Äô shouted Dolly, the youngest, and that became our rallying cry for
the next hour or two.</p>
<p>Dolly and her brother Mukesh picked up armfuls of books and carried them into
their room. But the floor was awash, so the books had to be piled on their beds. Dolly
was helping me gather some of my papers when a large field rat jumped on to the desk
in front of her. Dolly squealed and ran for the door.</p>
<p>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all right,‚Äô said Mukesh, whose love of animals extends even to field rats. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs
only sheltering from the storm.‚Äô</p>
<p>Big brother Rakesh whistled for our dog, Tony, but Tony wasn‚Äôt interested in rats
just then. He had taken shelter in the kitchen, the only dry spot in the house.</p>
<p>Two rooms were now practically roofless, and we could see the sky lit up by
flashes of lightning.</p>
<p>There were fireworks indoors, too, as water spluttered and crackled along a
damaged wire. Then the lights went out altogether</p>
<p>Rakesh, at his best in an emergency, had already lit two kerosene lamps. And by
their light we continued to transfer books, papers, and clothes to the children‚Äôs room.
</p>
<p>We noticed that the water on the floor was beginning to subside a little.</p>
<p>‚ÄòWhere is it going?‚Äô asked Dolly.</p>
<p>‚ÄòThrough the floor,‚Äô said Mukesh. ‚ÄòDown to the flat below!‚Äô</p>
<p>Cries of concern from our downstairs neighbours told us that they were having their
share of the flood.</p>
<p>Our feet were freezing because there hadn‚Äôt been time to put on proper footwear.
And besides, shoes and slippers were awash by now. All chairs and tables were piled
high with books. I hadn‚Äôt realised the extent of my library until that night!
</p>
<p>The available beds were pushed into the driest corner of the children‚Äôs room, and
there, huddled in blankets and quilts, we spent the remaining hours of the night while
the storm continued</p>
<p>Towards morning the wind fell, and it began to snow. Through the door to the sitting
room I could see snowflakes drifting through the gaps in the ceiling, settling on pictureframes. Ordinary things like a glue bottle and a small clock took on a certain beauty
when covered with soft snow.
</p>
<p>Most of us dozed off.</p>
<p>When dawn came, we found the windowpanes encrusted with snow and icicles. The
rising sun struck through the gaps in the ceiling and turned everything golden. Snow
crystals glistened on the empty bookshelves. But the books had been saved.</p>
<p>Rakesh went out to find a carpenter and tinsmith, while the rest of us started putting
things in the sun to dry. By evening we‚Äôd put much of the roof back on.
</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a much-improved roof now, and we look forward to the next storm with
confidence!</p>
