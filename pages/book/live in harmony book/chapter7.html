      <p>Chapter Seven</p>
      <p>  Music</p>
    </h1>
    <p>Chapter Inspiration: </p>
<p>“After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is
 music.” –Aldous Huxley
</p>
<p> “What do I do every night?  I listen to the silence-music of the twinkling stars.”–Sri Chinmoy
</p>
<p> “Music has charms to soothe the savage breast
 To soften rocks, or bend a knotted oak.” –William Congreve
</p>
<p> “Take a music bath once or twice a week for a few seasons, and you will find that
 it is to the soul what the water bath is to the body.”  –Oliver Wendell Holmes</p>
<p> “Music is the pathway to the heart.”  –Voltaire</p>
<p> “ Music makes people milder, and gentler, more moral and more reasonable.”–Martin Luthe
</p>
<p> “ Life is everywhere.  The earth is throbbing with it.  It’s like music. The plants,
 the creatures, the ones we see, the ones we don’t see, it’s like one big, pulsating
 symphony.” –Diane Frolov, Northern Exposure
</p>
<p> “When gripping grief the heart doth wound,
 And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
 Then music, with her silver sound
 With speedy help doth lend redress.” –William Shakespeare
</p>
<p>Chapter Story:</p>
<p> Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was born in Bonn, Germany. Today
 we refer to Ludwig by his last name – Beethoven.  Beethoven’s father wanted
 him to start learning music at a very young age – when he was only five years
 old.  Ludwig’s father wanted Ludwig to be like Mozart, who was the most
 famous musician at that time.  Beethoven did learn music at a young age, and he
 did eventually become famous, but the music he wrote in his life was very differ
ent from Mozart’s music!  By the age of twelve Beethoven was already an assis
tant to the local organist, who was also his teacher.  By this age, Beethoven was
 already composing his own music as well. (When a musician writes music it is
 called composing.)
</p>
<p> Beethoven’s mother died when he was seventeen years old and, at about
 the same time, Beethoven’s father had to go to live in a hospital because he was
 very sick from alcoholism.  Soon afterwards he also died. This meant that
 Beethoven had to care for his two younger brothers.  Even though Beethoven had
 these important responsibilities, he still continued practicing and composing his
 music.
</p>
<p> Beethoven moved to Vienna to study with one of the best musicians of
 that time, Franz Josef Hadyn.  He took his two brothers with him.  Beethoven
 liked Vienna so much that he stayed there for the rest of his life.  In Vienna,
 Beethoven continued to practice playing the piano, and he continued to compose
 his own music.  He wrote symphonies, sonatas, quartets and even a ballet.
 Some of Beethoven’s most famous pieces are his Eighth Piano Sonata, called the
 Pathetique, his Sixth Symphony, called the Pastoral Symphony, his Ninth Sym
phony, called the Ode to Joy, and, what is perhaps his most famous work, the
 Moonlight Sonata.  
</p>
<p>Beethoven’s music was very different from the other music of his time,
 and because of this it took Beethoven a long time to be accepted and appreciated.
 Some people did not like Beethoven’s music at all, and they wrote negative arti
cles about him and spread nasty rumors about him in order to discourage him.
 Beethoven did not let these things stop him.  He continued to make the kind of
 music that sprang up in his invisible heart, the music that he heard in his head,
 that was specially his and that nobody else could write.  Beethoven’s composi
tions contained many new musical ideas that were able to express deep feelings
 and powerful images.</p>
<p> One of the biggest challenges that Beethoven faced in his life was that
 when he was only thirty he started to go deaf.  Deafness is a difficult challenge
 for any person, but especially for a musician. His deafness became worse and
 worse, and finally he was unable to perform in public.  Because he could no
 longer hear people speak, and because deafness makes it very hard to speak prop
erly, Beethoven had to communicate with friends and visitors by writing things
 down on a slate or in little notebooks.  The amazing thing, though, is that
 Beethoven did not let his deafness stop him from composing music!  Beethoven
 composed many pieces of music during the period in which he was partially or
 totally deaf.  He could still hear music in his imagination, even though he could
 not hear it with his ears.  He was able to write down the music that he heard, so
 that others could play it.  In this way, even though he could no longer hear his</p>
<p>music with his ears, he was able to share it with others so they could hear it.  In
 this way he triumphed over his disability.    Beethoven’s independence and deter
mination as an artist, and his courage in overcoming adversity, have been an
 inspiration not just to musicians but also to poets, painters, dancers and other
 artists.  His life and his accomplishments continue to be an inspiration to all of us
 even today.</p>
<p> Chapter Overview:</p>
<p>There are many, many different kinds of music.  Besides the kind of music
 that Beethoven wrote, sometimes called “classical” music, there are jazz, blues,
 hip-hop, and others.  Music is something that everyone enjoys and everyone can
 benefit from. Did you know that human beings have been making music for thou
sands and thousands of years? Why do you think that is?  </p>
<p>Today, music is a very important part of our lives.  We find it everywhere.
 Can you name some places where you might find or hear music.  Let’s try to cele
brate music each day, or at least each week, here at school.  It will be a fun activi
ty we can do together.  We can all help to find different kinds of music that we
 can listen to.  We can also make up our own music and even make our own musi
cal instruments. Enjoying music will help us to feel harmony inside ourselves and
 also to make harmony in our classroom.</p>
<p> Chapter Lessons:</p>
<p> Lesson #1— Let’s enjoy music together every day</p>
<p>How many of you students have parents or grandparents who play a musi
cal instrument?  How many of you are learning an instrument yourselves?  If you
 are not yet learning an instrument, what instrument would you like to learn?
 Let’s make a list of as many musical instruments as we can think of.  How many
 did we come up with?  What is your favorite kind of music?  What is special
 about the kind of music you like?</p>
<p> Since we will be making lots of music together, we can make some percus
sion instruments to help us make rhythm for the songs we will sing. You can
 make a shaker or a drum, or both.  For a shaker, you can bring in an empty soda
 can.  Fill the can about one third to one half full with popcorn or small stones.
 Then seal the hole and decorate the can with some art paper.  To make a drum,
 bring in an empty, round Quaker Oatmeal container that still has the top.  Wipe
 out the inside of the box with a tissue or cloth. Seal the top with some strong tape.
 You can also decorate your drum with art paper or tissue paper.  Instead of the
 container top you can also cover the container with a piece of leather.  Now you
 have a drum! With your shaker or your drum you are ready to make music with
 your class.
</p>
<p> Lesson #2 — Music for personal reflection and to create harmony inside us</p>
<p>Listen for a few minutes to music for relaxation, such as Sri Chinmoy’s
 flute music.  Close your eyes while you are listening to the music.  Let your
 breath flow smoothly and gently, in and out. When you breathe in, let your breath
 go way down into your belly, and when you breathe out, let as much of your
 breath out as you can before you breathe in again.  As you listen to the music
 allow all of your muscles to relax.  Let go of any tension you are feeling.  Let
 your mind become calm and quiet.  The music can fill you with peaceful energy,
 if you focus on it and let your thoughts flow along with it.  Now open your eyes
 and rest for a few moments. Did the music help you to feel peaceful?
</p>
<p> Lesson #3 — Music for visualization – Moonlight Sonata of Beethoven</p>
<p> Dim the lights in the room to create a peaceful atmosphere. Close your
 eyes and listen to the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven. As you listen to
 Beethoven’s music, imagine the moon shining on the waves of the ocean. In your
 mind’s eye see the waves rolling into the shore and shining like twinkling dia
monds in the light of the moon.  Imagine you can hear the waves and feel the
 sand under your feet. Imagine there is nobody on the beach except for you.  Imag
ine you are feeling peaceful and joyful at the sight of the beautiful, shimmering
 waves.   When the music is over gently open your eyes. Share with the class what
 you saw in your imagination and how Beethoven’s music made you feel.
</p>
<p> Lesson #4 – Music to teach about feelings
</p>
<p> What kinds of feelings do you get when you listen to music?  Listen to
 three or four different kinds of music – classical, jazz, relaxation music, hip-hop,
 or rock.  What kinds of feelings do you get from the different kinds of music?
 What kind of music would you like to listen to when you are reading or doing
 school work?  What kind of music would you like to dance to?  What kind of
 music makes you feel the most peaceful? What kind of music would you like to
 listen to just for fun?  Different kinds of music help us to feel different things.
 Music can be our friend when we are lonely or sad, and music can help us cele
brate when we are feeling happy or excited.</p>

 <p>You Are My Sunshine</p>
</p>
<p> Lesson #5 — Music to teach about virtues
</p>
<p> Music can be an excellent way to learn about virtues.  For example, the
 song, This Land is My Land, by Woody Guthrie, is a song about compassion.
 Woody Guthrie wrote this song during the Great Depression in the United States,
 when many people did not have jobs or enough food to eat.  New immigrants
 were coming to America and some people who were already here were saying,
 “We don’t even have enough food for ourselves, why should we let more people
 come here?”  Woody Guthrie had a different philosophy.  In his song he says,
 “This land is your land, this land is my land … this land was made for you and
 me.” In other words, this land of America is for everyone who wants to come,
 work hard, and join our community.  We can learn lessons like this from many
 songs – especially from folk songs from America and other lands around the
 world.
</p>
<p> Recommended Songs:
    <p>This Land is Your Land– Woody Guthrie</p>
    <p> The Sparrow and The Thief– Andrew Kutt</p>
    <p> This Little Light of Mine</p>
    <p> Make New Friends</p>
</p>
<p> Lesson #6 – Music from other lands 
</p>
<p>Music is an ideal way for us to learn about the people of other cultures.
 Each culture of the world has its own kind of music.  The music of each culture
 expresses the feelings, dreams, ideas, and stories of that culture. When people of
 other cultures sing and dance to their own music, they feel they are expressing the
 soul or message of their culture.  So, when we learn and play music from some
one else’s culture we can gain a deeper understanding of people who are different
 from ourselves.  Music from other cultures can help us to feel connected with oth
ers from around the world. </p>

 Mountain.</p>
<p class="side"> Lesson #8 — Music for peace and harmony</p>
<p> And Every One with Their Vine and Fig Tree is a traditional song based
 upon a verse from the Old Testament of the Bible. It is a wonderful song to sing
 whenever you want to bring forth a peaceful spirit and create a feeling of harmo
ny. Below are the words to the song. In italics after each line are some move
ments you can do along with the song to bring it more to life.</p>
<p> And everyone with their vine and fig tree.</p>
<p> With one hand make the motion of a vine growing, by putting your thumb and
 your first two fingers together and moving them upward in a swirling motion.
 With the other hand make the motion of a fig tree blossoming, by letting your fin
gertips wiggle as your hand rises higher.</p>
<p> Shall live in peace and unafraid</p>
<p>Both hands cross flat one over the other in the middle of your chest</p>
<p> And everyone with their vine and fig tree </p>
<p>Repeat movements as above</p>
<p> Shall live in peace and unafraid</p>
<p> Repeat movements as above</p>
<p> And into ploughshares turn their swords</p>
<p> Starting with hands folded in the center of the chest, spread your hands slowly
 outward as if to embrace the sky. Then above your forehead let your hands come
 together again. Finally let your hands come to rest again – 
folded in front of your chest.</p>
<p>Nations shall make war no more</p>
<p> With folded hands bow forward gently</p>
<p>And into ploughshares turn their swords</p>
<p> Repeat movements as above</p>
<p> Nations shall make war no more</p>
<p>Repeat movements as above</p>
<p> Alternate Verse: We shall be friends more and more</p>
