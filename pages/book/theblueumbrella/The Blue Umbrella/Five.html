    </h1>
    <p>BINYA was in the forest glade where she had first seen the umbrella. No
one came there for picnics during the monsoon. The grass was always
wet and the pine-needles were slippery underfoot. The tall trees shut
out the light, and poisonous-looking mushrooms, orange and purple, sprang
up everywhere. But it was a good place for porcupines, who seemed to like
the mushrooms; and Binya was searching for porcupine-quills.</p>
<p>The hill people didn’t think much of porcupine-quills, but far away in
southern India the quills were valued as charms and sold at a rupee each. So
Ram Bharosa paid a tenth of a rupee for each quill brought to him, and he in
turn sold the quills at a profit to a trader from the plains</p>
<p>Binya had already found five quills, and she knew there’d be more in
the long grass. For once, she’d put her umbrella down. She had to put it
aside if she was to search the ground thoroughly.</p>
<p>It was Rajaram’s chance.
</p>
<p>He’d been following Binya for some time, concealing himself behind
trees and rocks, creeping closer whenever she became absorbed in her
search. He was anxious that she should not see him and be able to recognize
him later</p>
<p>He waited until Binya had wandered some distance from the umbrella.
Then, running forward at a crouch, he seized the open umbrella and dashed
off with it.
</p>
<p>But Rajaram had very big feet. Binya heard his heavy footsteps and
turned just in tune to see him as he disappeared between the trees. She cried
out, dropped the porcupine-quills, and gave chase.</p>
<p>Binya was swift and sure-footed, but Rajaram had a long stride. All the
same, he made the mistake of running downhill. A long-legged person is
much faster going up hill than down. Binya reached the edge of the forest
glade in time to see the thief scrambling down the path to the stream. He
had closed the umbrella so that it would not hinder his flight.</p>
<p>Binya was beginning to gain on the boy. He kept to the path, while she
simply slid and leapt down the steep hillside. Near the bottom of the hill the
path began to straighten out, and it was here that the long-legged boy began
to forge ahead again.
</p>
<p>Bijju was coming home from another direction. He had a bundle of
sticks which he’d collected for the kitchen fire. As he reached the path, he
saw Binya rushing down the hill as though all the mountain-spirits in
Garhwal were after her.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” he called. “Why are you running?”</p>
<p>Binya paused only to point at the fleeing Rajaram.</p>
<p>“My umbrella!” she cried. “He has stolen it!”</p>
<p>Bijju dropped his bundle of sticks, and ran after his sister. When he
reached her side, he said, “I’ll soon catch him!” and went sprinting away
over the lush green grass. He was fresh, and he was soon well ahead of
Binya and gaining on the thief.
</p>
<p>Rajaram was crossing the shallow stream when Bijju caught up with
him. Rajaram was the taller boy, but Bijju was much stronger. He flung
himself at the thief, caught him by the legs, and brought him down in the
water. Rajaram got to his feet, and tried to drag himself away; but Bijju still
had him by a leg. Rajaram overbalanced and came down with a great
splash. He had let the umbrella fall. It began to float away on the current.
Just then Binya arrived, flushed and breathless, and went dashing into the
stream after the umbrella.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a tremendous fight was taking place. Locked in fierce
combat, the two boys swayed together on a rock, tumbled on to the sand,
rolled over and over the pebbled bank until they were again threshing about
in the shallows of the stream. The magpies, bulbuls and other birds were
disturbed, and flew away with cries of alarm.
</p>
<p>Covered with mud, gasping and spluttering, the boys groped for each
other in the water. After five minutes of frenzied struggle, Bijju emerged
victorious. Rajaram lay flat on his back on the sand, exhausted, while Bijju
sat astride him, pinning him down with his arms and legs.
</p>
<p>“Let me get up!” gasped Rajaram. “let me go—i don’t want your
useless umbrella!”</p>
<p>“Then why did you take it?” demanded Bijju. “Come on—tell me
why!”</p>
<p>“It was that skinflint Ram Bharosa,” said Rajaram. “He told me to get it
for him. He said if I didn’t fetch it, I’d lose my job.”</p>
