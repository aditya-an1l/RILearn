      <p>And Now We are Twelve</p>
    </h1>
    <p>People often ask me why I’ve chosen to live in Mussoorie for so long – almost forty
years, without any significant breaks.</p>
<p>‘I forgot to go away,’ I tell them, but of course, that isn’t the real reason.
</p>
<p>The people here are friendly, but then people are friendly in a great many other
places. The hills, the valleys are beautiful; but they are just as beautiful in Kulu or
Kumaon.</p>
<p>‘This is where the family has grown up and where we all live,’ I say, and those who
don’t know me are puzzled because the general impression of the writer is of a
reclusive old bachelor.
</p>
<p>Unmarried I may be, but single I am not. Not since Prem came to live and work with
me in 1970. A year later, he was married. Then his children came along and stole my
heart; and when they grew up, their children came along and stole my wits. So now I’m
an enchanted bachelor, head of a family of twelve. Sometimes I go out to bat,
sometimes to bowl, but generally I prefer to be twelfth man, carrying out the drinks.</p>
<p>In the old days, when I was a solitary writer living on baked beans, the prospect of
my suffering from obesity was very remote. Now there is a little more of author than
there used to be, and the other day five-year-old Gautam patted me on my tummy (or
balcony, as I prefer to call it) and remarked; ‘Dada, you should join the WWF.’
</p>
<p>‘I’m already a member,’ I said, ‘I joined the World Wildlife Fund years ago.’</p>
<p>‘Not that,’ he said. ‘I mean the World Wrestling Federation.’</p>
<p>If I have a tummy today, it’s thanks to Gautam’s grandfather and now his mother who,
over the years, have made sure that I am well-fed and well-proportioned.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, when I was a lean young man, people would look at me and say,
‘Poor chap, he’s definitely undernourished. What on earth made him take up writing as
a profession?’ Now they look at me and say, ‘You wouldn’t think he was a writer,
would you? Too well nourished!’</p>
<p>It was a cold, wet and windy March evening when Prem came back from the village
with his wife and first-born child, then just four months old. In those days, they had to
walk to the house from the bus stand; it was a half-hour walk in the cold rain, and the
baby was all wrapped up when they entered the front room. Finally, I got a glimpse of
him. And he of me, and it was friendship at first sight. Little Rakesh (as he was to be
called) grabbed me by the nose and held on. He did not have much of a nose to grab,
but he had a dimpled chin and I played with it until he smiled.
</p>
<p>The little chap spent a good deal of his time with me during those first two years in
Maplewood – learning to crawl, to toddle, and then to walk unsteadily about the little
sitting-room. I would carry him into the garden, and later, up the steep gravel path to the
main road. Rakesh enjoyed these little excursions, and so did I, because in pointing out
trees, flowers, birds, butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers, et al, I was giving myself a
chance to observe them better instead of just taking them for granted.
</p>
<p>In particular, there was a pair of squirrels that lived in the big oak tree outside the
cottage. Squirrels are rare in Mussoorie though common enough down in the valley.
This couple must have come up for the summer. They became quite friendly, and
although they never got around to taking food from our hands, they were soon entering
the house quite freely. The sitting room window opened directly on to the oak tree
whose various denizens – ranging from stag-beetles to small birds and even an
acrobatic bat – took to darting in and out of the cottage at various times of the day or
night.</p>
<p>Life at Maplewood was quite idyllic, and when Rakesh’s baby brother, Suresh,
came into the world, it seemed we were all set for a long period of domestic bliss; but
at such times tragedy is often lurking just around the corner. Suresh was just over a year
old when he contracted tetanus. Doctors and hospitals were of no avail. He suffered –
as any child would from this terrible affliction – and left this world before he had a
chance of getting to know it. His parents were broken-hearted. And I feared for Rakesh,
for he wasn’t a very healthy boy, and two of his cousins in the village had already
succumbed to tuberculosis.</p>
<p>It was to be a difficult year for me. A criminal charge was brought against me for a
slightly risqué story I’d written for a Bombay magazine. I had to face trial in Bombay
and this involved three journeys there over a period of a year and a half, before an irate
but perceptive judge found the charges baseless and gave me an honourable acquittal.</p>
<p>It’s the only time I’ve been involved with the law and I sincerely hope it is the last.
Most cases drag on interminably, and the main beneficiaries are the lawyers. My trial
would have been much longer had not the prosecutor died of a heart attack in the middle
of the proceedings. His successor did not pursue it with the same vigour. His heart was
not in it. The whole issue had started with a complaint by a local politician, and when
he lost interest so did the prosecution. Nevertheless the trial, once begun, had to be
seen through. The defence (organised by the concerned magazine) marshalled its
witnesses (which included Nissim Ezekiel and the Marathi playwright Vijay
Tendulkar). I made a short speech which couldn’t have been very memorable as I have
forgotten it! And everyone, including the judge, was bored with the whole business.
After that, I steered clear of controversial publications. I have never set out to shock the
world. Telling a meaningful story was all that really mattered. And that is still the case.
</p>
<p>I was looking forward to continuing our idyllic existence in Maplewood, but it was
not to be. The powers-that-be, in the shape of the Public Works Department (PWD), had
decided to build a ‘strategic’ road just below the cottage and without any warning to us,
all the trees in the vicinity were felled (including the friendly old oak) and the hillside
was rocked by explosives and bludgeoned by bulldozers. I decided it was time to
move. Prem and Chandra (Rakesh’s mother) wanted to move too; not because of the
road, but because they associated the house with the death of little Suresh, whose
presence seemed to haunt every room, every corner of the cottage. His little cries of
pain and suffering still echoed through the still hours of the night.
</p>
<p>I rented rooms at the top of Landour, a good thousand feet higher up the mountain.
Rakesh was now old enough to go to school, and every morning I would walk with him
down to the little convent school near the clock tower. Prem would go to fetch him in
the afternoon. The walk took us about half-an-hour, and on the way Rakesh would ask
for a story and I would have to rack my brains in order to invent one. I am not the most
inventive of writers, and fantastical plots are beyond me. My forte is observation,
recollection, and reflection. Small boys prefer action. So I invented a leopard who
suffered from acute indigestion because he’d eaten one human too many and a belt
buckle was causing an obstruction.
</p>
<p>This went down quite well until Rakesh asked me how the leopard got around the
problem of the victim’s clothes.
</p>
<p>‘The secret,’ I said, ‘is to pounce on them when their trousers are off!’
</p>
<p>Not the stuff of which great picture books are made, but then, I’ve never attempted to
write stories for beginners. Red Riding Hood’s granny-eating wolf always scared me
as a small boy, and yet parents have always found it acceptable for toddlers. Possibly
they feel grannies are expendable</p>
<p>Mukesh was born around this time and Savitri (Dolly) a couple of years later. When
Dolly grew older, she was annoyed at having been named Savitri (my choice), which is
now considered very old-fashioned; so we settled for Dolly. I can understand a child’s
dissatisfaction with given names.
</p>
<p>My first name was Owen, which in Welsh means ‘brave’. As I am not in the least
brave, I have preferred not to use it. One given name and one surname should be
enough.</p>
<p>When my granny said, ‘But you should try to be brave, otherwise how will you
survive in this cruel world?’ I replied: ‘Don’t worry, I can run very fast.’</p>
<p>Not that I’ve ever had to do much running, except when I was pursued by a lissome
Australian lady who thought I’d make a good obedient husband. It wasn’t so much the
lady I was running from, but the prospect of spending the rest of my life in some remote
cattle station in the Australian outback. Anyone who has tried to drag me away from
India has always met with stout resistance.</p>
<p>Up on the heights of Landour lived a motley crowd. My immediate neighbours included
a Frenchwoman who played the sitar (very badly) all through the night; and a Spanish
lady with two husbands, one of whom practised acupuncture – rather ineffectively as
far as he was concerned, for he seemed to be dying of some mysterious debilitating
disease. Another neighbour came and went rather mysteriously, and finally ended up in
Tihar jail, having been apprehended at Delhi carrying a large amount of contraband
hashish.
</p>
<p>Apart from these and a few other colourful characters, the area was inhabitated by
some very respectable people, retired brigadiers, air marshals and rear admirals,
almost all of whom were busy writing their memoirs. I had to read or listen to extracts
from their literary efforts. This was slow torture. A few years before, I had done a stint
of editing for a magazine called Imprint. It had involved going through hundreds of
badly written manuscripts, and in some cases (friends of the owner!) rewriting some of
them for publication. One of life’s joys had been to throw up that particular job, and
now here I was, besieged by all the top brass of the army, navy and air force, each one
determined that I should read, inwardly digest, improve, and if possible find a
publisher for their outpourings. Thank goodness they were all retired. I could not be
shot or court-martialled. But at least two of them set their wives upon me, and these
intrepid ladies would turn up around noon with my ‘homework’ – typescripts to read
and edit! There was no escape. My own writing was of no consequence to them. I told
them that I was taking sitar lessons, but they disapproved, saying I was more suited to
the tabla.</p>
<p>When Prem discovered a set of vacant rooms further down the Landour slope, close
to school and bazaar, I rented them without hesitation. This was Ivy Cottage. Come up
and see me sometime, but leave your manuscripts behind.</p>
<p>When we came to Ivy Cottage in 1980, we were six, Dolly having just been born.
Now, twenty-four years later, we are twelve. I think that’s a reasonable expansion. The
increase has been brought about by Rakesh’s marriage twelve years ago, and Mukesh’s
marriage two years ago. Both precipitated themselves into marriage when they were
barely twenty, and both were lucky. Beena and Binita, who happen to be real sisters,
have brightened and enlivened our lives with their happy, positive natures and the
wonderful children they have brought into the world. More about them later.</p>
<p>Ivy Cottage has, on the whole, been kind to us, and particularly kind to me. Some
houses like their occupants, others don’t. Maplewood, set in the shadow of the hill,
lacked a natural cheerfulness; there was a settled gloom about the place. The house at
the top of Landour was too exposed to the elements to have any sort of character. The
wind moaning in the deodars may have inspired the sitar player but it did nothing for
my writing. I produced very little up there.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ivy Cottage – especially my little room facing the sunrise – has
been conducive to creative work. Novellas, poems, essays, children’s stories,
anthologies, have all come tumbling on to whatever sheets of paper happen to be
nearest me. As I write by hand, I have only to grab for the nearest pad, loose sheet,
page-proof or envelope whenever the muse take hold of me; which is surprisingly often</p>
<p>I came here when I was nearing fifty. Now I’m approaching eighty, and instead of
drying up, as some writers do in their later years, I find myself writing with as much
ease and assurance as when I was twenty. And I enjoy writing, it’s not a burdensome
task. I may not have anything of earth-shattering significance to convey to the world, but
in conveying my sentiments to you, dear readers, and in telling you something about my
relationship with people and the natural world, I hope to bring a little pleasure and
sunshine into your life.
</p>
<p>Life isn’t a bed of roses, not for any of us, and I have never had the comforts or
luxuries that wealth can provide. But here I am, doing my own thing, in my own time
and my own way. What more can I ask of life? Give me a big cash prize and I’d still be
here. I happen to like the view from my window. And I like to have Gautam coming up
to me, patting me on the tummy, and telling me that I’ll make a good goalkeeper one day.
</p>
<p>It’s a Sunday morning, as I come to the conclusion of this chapter. There’s bedlam in
the house. Siddharth’s football keeps smashing against the front door. Shrishti is
practising her dance routine in the back verandah. Gautam has cut his finger and is
trying his best to bandage it with cellotape. He is, of course, the youngest of Rakesh’s
three musketeers, and probably the most independent-minded. Siddharth, now ten, is
restless, never quite able to expend all his energy. ‘Does not pay enough attention,’ says
his teacher. It must be hard for anyone to pay attention in a class of sixty! How does the
poor teacher pay attention?</p>
<p>If you, dear reader, have any ambitions to be a writer, you must first rid yourself of
any notion that perfect peace and quiet is the first requirement. There is no such thing as
perfect peace and quiet except perhaps in a monastery or a cave in the mountains. And
what would you write about, living in a cave? One should be able to write in a train, a
bus, a bullock-cart, in good weather or bad, on a park bench or in the middle of a noisy
classroom.
</p>
<p>Of course, the best place is the sun-drenched desk right next to my bed. It isn’t
always sunny here, but on a good day like this, it’s ideal. The children are getting ready
for school, dogs are barking in the street, and down near the water tap there’s an
altercation between two women with empty buckets, the tap having dried up. But these
are all background noises and will subside in due course. They are not directed at me.
</p>
<p>Hello! Here’s Atish, Mukesh’s little ten-month old infant, crawling over the rug,
curious to know why I’m sitting on the edge of my bed scribbling away, when I should
be playing with him. So I shall play with him for five minutes and then come back to
this page. Giving him my time is important. After all, I won’t be around when he grows
up.
</p>
<p>Half-an-hour later. Atish soon tired of playing with me, but meanwhile Gautam had
absconded with my pen. When I asked him to return it, he asked, ‘Why don’t you get a
computer? Then we can play games on it.’</p>
<p>‘My pen is faster than any computer,’ I tell him. ‘I wrote three pages this morning
without getting out of bed. And yesterday I wrote two pages sitting under the chestnut
tree.’</p>
<p>‘Until a chestnut fell on your head,’ says Gautam, ‘did it hurt?’</p>
<p>‘Only a little,’ I said, putting on a brave front.</p>
<p>He had saved the chestnut and now he showed it to me. The smooth brown horsechestnut shone in the sunlight.
</p>
<p>Let’s stick it in the ground,’ I said. ‘Then in the spring a chestnut tree will come up.’</p>
<p>So we went outside and planted the chestnut on a plot of wasteland. Hopefully a
small tree will burst through the earth at about the time this book is published.
</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, Rakesh and I had planted a cherry seed on the hillside. It grew into
a tree, which is still bursting with blossoms every year. Now it’s Gautam’s turn. And so
we move on.</p>
