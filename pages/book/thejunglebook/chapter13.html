It had been raining heavily for one whole month—raining on a camp of thirty
thousand men and thousands of camels, elephants, horses, bullocks, and mules
all gathered together at a place called Rawal Pindi, to be reviewed by the
Viceroy of India. He was receiving a visit from the Amir of Afghanistan—a wild
king of a very wild country. The Amir had brought with him for a bodyguard
eight hundred men and horses who had never seen a camp or a locomotive before
in their lives—savage men and savage horses from somewhere at the back of
Central Asia. Every night a mob of these horses would be sure to break their
heel ropes and stampede up and down the camp through the mud in the dark, or
the camels would break loose and run about and fall over the ropes of the
tents, and you can imagine how pleasant that was for men trying to go to sleep.
My tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe. But one
night a man popped his head in and shouted, “Get out, quick! They’re coming! My
tent’s gone!”
</p>
<p>
I knew who “they” were, so I put on my boots and waterproof and scuttled out
into the slush. Little Vixen, my fox terrier, went out through the other side;
and then there was a roaring and a grunting and bubbling, and I saw the tent
cave in, as the pole snapped, and begin to dance about like a mad ghost. A
camel had blundered into it, and wet and angry as I was, I could not help
laughing. Then I ran on, because I did not know how many camels might have got
loose, and before long I was out of sight of the camp, plowing my way through
the mud.
</p>
<div >
<img alt="image" src="Screenshot 2025-07-05 155904.png" >
<p ><b>A camel had blundered into my tent.</b></p>
</div>
<p>
At last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was somewhere
near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at night. As I did not
want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and the dark, I put my waterproof
over the muzzle of one gun, and made a sort of wigwam with two or three rammers
that I found, and lay along the tail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had
got to, and where I might be.
</p>
<p>
Just as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness and a
grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to a screw-gun
battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings and chains and
things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little cannon made in two
pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes to use them. They are
taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find a road, and they are very
useful for fighting in rocky country.
</p>
<p>
Behind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching and
slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a strayed hen’s.
Luckily, I knew enough of beast language—not wild-beast language, but
camp-beast language, of course—from the natives to know what he was saying.
</p>
<p>
He must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to the mule,
“What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white thing that
waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.” (That was my broken tent
pole, and I was very glad to know it.) “Shall we run on?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it was you,” said the mule, “you and your friends, that have been
disturbing the camp? All right. You’ll be beaten for this in the morning. But I
may as well give you something on account now.”
</p>
<p>
I heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel two kicks in
the ribs that rang like a drum. “Another time,” he said, “you’ll know better
than to run through a mule battery at night, shouting `Thieves and fire!’ Sit
down, and keep your silly neck quiet.”
</p>
<p>
The camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down
whimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big
troop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped a gun
tail, and landed close to the mule.
</p>
<p>
“It’s disgraceful,” he said, blowing out his nostrils. “Those camels have
racketed through our lines again—the third time this week. How’s a horse to
keep his condition if he isn’t allowed to sleep. Who’s here?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw Battery,” said
the mule, “and the other’s one of your friends. He’s waked me up too. Who are
you?”
</p>
<p>
“Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers—Dick Cunliffe’s horse. Stand over a
little, there.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, beg your pardon,” said the mule. “It’s too dark to see much. Aren’t these
camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get a little
peace and quiet here.”
</p>
<p>
“My lords,” said the camel humbly, “we dreamed bad dreams in the night, and we
were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th Native Infantry,
and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why didn’t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native Infantry,
instead of running all round the camp?” said the mule.
</p>
<p>
“They were such very bad dreams,” said the camel. “I am sorry. Listen! What is
that? Shall we run on again?”
</p>
<p>
“Sit down,” said the mule, “or you’ll snap your long stick-legs between the
guns.” He cocked one ear and listened. “Bullocks!” he said. “Gun bullocks. On
my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very thoroughly. It takes a
good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.”
</p>
<p>
I heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky white
bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won’t go any nearer
to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost stepping on the
chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for “Billy.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s one of our recruits,” said the old mule to the troop horse. “He’s
calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never hurt anybody
yet.”
</p>
<p>
The gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the young
mule huddled close to Billy.
</p>
<p>
“Things!” he said. “Fearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our lines while
we were asleep. D’you think they’ll kill us?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ve a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,” said Billy. “The
idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the battery before
this gentleman!”
</p>
<p>
“Gently, gently!” said the troop-horse. “Remember they are always like this to
begin with. The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia when I was a
three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if I’d seen a camel, I should have
been running still.”
</p>
<p>
Nearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from
Australia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.
</p>
<p>
“True enough,” said Billy. “Stop shaking, youngster. The first time they put
the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on my forelegs and
kicked every bit of it off. I hadn’t learned the real science of kicking then,
but the battery said they had never seen anything like it.”
</p>
<p>
“But this wasn’t harness or anything that jingled,” said the young mule. “You
know I don’t mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and they fell up
and down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and I couldn’t find my
driver, and I couldn’t find you, Billy, so I ran off with—with these
gentlemen.”
</p>
<p>
“H’m!” said Billy. “As soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away on my
own account. When a battery—a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks gentlemen, he
must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the ground there?”
</p>
<p>
The gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: “The seventh
yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We were asleep when the camels
came, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked away. It is better to
lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good bedding. We told your friend
here that there was nothing to be afraid of, but he knew so much that he
thought otherwise. Wah!”
</p>
<p>
They went on chewing.
</p>
<p>
“That comes of being afraid,” said Billy. “You get laughed at by gun-bullocks.
I hope you like it, young un.”
</p>
<p>
The young mule’s teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not being
afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks only clicked
their horns together and went on chewing.
</p>

<p ><b>“Anybody can be forgiven for being scared in the night,”
said the troop-horse</b></p>
</div>
<p>
“Now, don’t be angry after you’ve been afraid. That’s the worst kind of
cowardice,” said the troop-horse. “Anybody can be forgiven for being scared in
the night, I think, if they see things they don’t understand. We’ve broken out
of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty of us, just because a
new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at home in Australia till we
were scared to death of the loose ends of our head-ropes.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all very well in camp,” said Billy. “I’m not above stampeding myself,
for the fun of the thing, when I haven’t been out for a day or two. But what do
you do on active service?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, that’s quite another set of new shoes,” said the troop horse. “Dick
Cunliffe’s on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have to do
is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs well under me,
and be bridle-wise.”
</p>
<p>
“What’s bridle-wise?” said the young mule.
</p>
<p>
“By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,” snorted the troop-horse, “do you mean to
say that you aren’t taught to be bridle-wise in your business? How can you do
anything, unless you can spin round at once when the rein is pressed on your
neck? It means life or death to your man, and of course that’s life and death
to you. Get round with your hind legs under you the instant you feel the rein
on your neck. If you haven’t room to swing round, rear up a little and come
round on your hind legs. That’s being bridle-wise.”
</p>
<p>
“We aren’t taught that way,” said Billy the mule stiffly. “We’re taught to obey
the man at our head: step off when he says so, and step in when he says so. I
suppose it comes to the same thing. Now, with all this fine fancy business and
rearing, which must be very bad for your hocks, what do you do?”
</p>
<p>
“That depends,” said the troop-horse. “Generally I have to go in among a lot of
yelling, hairy men with knives—long shiny knives, worse than the farrier’s
knives—and I have to take care that Dick’s boot is just touching the next man’s
boot without crushing it. I can see Dick’s lance to the right of my right eye,
and I know I’m safe. I shouldn’t care to be the man or horse that stood up to
Dick and me when we’re in a hurry.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t the knives hurt?” said the young mule.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn’t Dick’s fault—”
</p>
<p>
“A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!” said the young
mule.
</p>
<p>
“You must,” said the troop horse. “If you don’t trust your man, you may as well
run away at once. That’s what some of our horses do, and I don’t blame them. As
I was saying, it wasn’t Dick’s fault. The man was lying on the ground, and I
stretched myself not to tread on him, and he slashed up at me. Next time I have
to go over a man lying down I shall step on him—hard.”
</p>
<div >

<p ><b>The man was lying on the ground, and I stretched myself not

</div>
<p>
“H’m!” said Billy. “It sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things at any
time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a well-balanced
saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and creep and crawl and
wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet above anyone else on a ledge
where there’s just room enough for your hoofs. Then you stand still and keep
quiet—never ask a man to hold your head, young un—keep quiet while the guns are
being put together, and then you watch the little poppy shells drop down into
the tree-tops ever so far below.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you ever trip?” said the troop-horse.
</p>
<p>
“They say that when a mule trips you can split a hen’s ear,” said Billy. “Now
and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but it’s very
seldom. I wish I could show you our business. It’s beautiful. Why, it took me
three years to find out what the men were driving at. The science of the thing
is never to show up against the sky line, because, if you do, you may get fired
at. Remember that, young un. Always keep hidden as much as possible, even if
you have to go a mile out of your way. I lead the battery when it comes to that
sort of climbing.”
</p>
<p>
“Fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!” said
the troop-horse, thinking hard. “I couldn’t stand that. I should want to
charge—with Dick.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, you wouldn’t. You know that as soon as the guns are in position
they’ll do all the charging. That’s scientific and neat. But knives—pah!”
</p>
<p>
The baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time past,
anxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him say, as he cleared his
throat, nervously:
</p>
<p>
“I—I—I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that running way.”
</p>
<p>
“No. Now you mention it,” said Billy, “you don’t look as though you were made
for climbing or running—much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?”
</p>
<p>
“The proper way,” said the camel. “We all sat down—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my crupper and breastplate!” said the troop-horse under his breath. “Sat
down!”
</p>
<p>
“We sat down—a hundred of us,” the camel went on, “in a big square, and the men
piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired over our backs,
the men did, on all sides of the square.”
</p>
<p>
“What sort of men? Any men that came along?” said the troop-horse. “They teach
us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across us, but Dick
Cunliffe is the only man I’d trust to do that. It tickles my girths, and,
besides, I can’t see with my head on the ground.”
</p>
<p>
“What does it matter who fires across you?” said the camel. “There are plenty
of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many clouds of smoke. I
am not frightened then. I sit still and wait.”
</p>
<p>
“And yet,” said Billy, “you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at night. Well,
well! Before I’d lie down, not to speak of sitting down, and let a man fire
across me, my heels and his head would have something to say to each other. Did
you ever hear anything so awful as that?”
</p>
<p>
There was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his big
head and said, “This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way of
fighting.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, go on,” said Billy. “Please don’t mind me. I suppose you fellows fight
standing on your tails?”
</p>
<p>
“Only one way,” said the two together. (They must have been twins.) “This is
that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon as Two Tails
trumpets.” (“Two Tails” is camp slang for the elephant.)
</p>
<p>
“What does Two Tails trumpet for?” said the young mule.
</p>
<p>
“To show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other side. Two
Tails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all together—Heya—Hullah!
Heeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor run like calves. We go across the
level plain, twenty yoke of us, till we are unyoked again, and we graze while
the big guns talk across the plain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of
the wall fall out, and the dust goes up as though many cattle were coming
home.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh! And you choose that time for grazing?” said the young mule.
</p>
<p>
“That time or any other. Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked up
again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it. Sometimes
there are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of us are killed, and
then there is all the more grazing for those that are left. This is Fate. None
the less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is the proper way to fight. We are
brothers from Hapur. Our father was a sacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ve certainly learned something tonight,” said the troop-horse. “Do you
gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you are being
fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?”
</p>
<p>
“About as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all over us,
or run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff. A mountain ledge, a
well-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you pick your own way, and
I’m your mule. But—the other things—no!” said Billy, with a stamp of his foot.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said the troop horse, “everyone is not made in the same way, and I
can quite see that your family, on your father’s side, would fail to understand
a great many things.”
</p>
<p>
“Never you mind my family on my father’s side,” said Billy angrily, for every
mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey. “My father was a
Southern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into rags every
horse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!”
</p>
<p>
Brumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of Sunol if
a car-horse called her a “skate,” and you can imagine how the Australian horse
felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.
</p>
<p>
“See here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,” he said between his teeth,
“I’d have you know that I’m related on my mother’s side to Carbine, winner of
the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we aren’t accustomed to being ridden
over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed, pig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter
battery. Are you ready?”
</p>
<p>
“On your hind legs!” squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each other, and
I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly voice, called out of the
darkness to the right—“Children, what are you fighting about there? Be quiet.”
</p>
<p>
Both beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor mule
can bear to listen to an elephant’s voice.
</p>
<p>
“It’s Two Tails!” said the troop-horse. “I can’t stand him. A tail at each end
isn’t fair!”
</p>
<p>
“My feelings exactly,” said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for company.
“We’re very alike in some things.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose we’ve inherited them from our mothers,” said the troop horse. “It’s
not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. “I’m picketed for the
night. I’ve heard what you fellows have been saying. But don’t be afraid. I’m
not coming over.”
</p>
<p>
The bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, “Afraid of Two Tails—what
nonsense!” And the bullocks went on, “We are sorry that you heard, but it is
true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly like a
little boy saying a poem, “I don’t quite know whether you’d understand.”
</p>
<p>
“We don’t, but we have to pull the guns,” said the bullocks.
</p>
<p>
“I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think you are. But
it’s different with me. My battery captain called me a Pachydermatous
Anachronism the other day.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s another way of fighting, I suppose?” said Billy, who was recovering his
spirits.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt and
between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what will happen
when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can’t.”
</p>
<p>
“I can,” said the troop-horse. “At least a little bit. I try not to think about
it.”
</p>
<p>
“I can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there’s a great deal
of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to cure me when I’m
sick. All they can do is to stop my driver’s pay till I get well, and I can’t
trust my driver.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah!” said the troop horse. “That explains it. I can trust Dick.”
</p>
<p>
“You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me feel any
better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough to go on in
spite of it.”
</p>
<p>
“We do not understand,” said the bullocks.
</p>
<p>
“I know you don’t. I’m not talking to you. You don’t know what blood is.”
</p>
<p>
“We do,” said the bullocks. “It is red stuff that soaks into the ground and
smells.”
</p>
<p>
The troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk of it,” he said. “I can smell it now, just thinking of it. It makes
me want to run—when I haven’t Dick on my back.”
</p>
<p>
“But it is not here,” said the camel and the bullocks. “Why are you so stupid?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s vile stuff,” said Billy. “I don’t want to run, but I don’t want to talk
about it.”
</p>
<p>
“There you are!” said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.
</p>
<p>
“Surely. Yes, we have been here all night,” said the bullocks.
</p>
<p>
Two Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. “Oh, I’m not
talking to you. You can’t see inside your heads.”
</p>
<p>
“No. We see out of our four eyes,” said the bullocks. “We see straight in front
of us.”
</p>
<p>
“If I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn’t be needed to pull the big
guns at all. If I was like my captain—he can see things inside his head before
the firing begins, and he shakes all over, but he knows too much to run away—if
I was like him I could pull the guns. But if I were as wise as all that I
should never be here. I should be a king in the forest, as I used to be,
sleeping half the day and bathing when I liked. I haven’t had a good bath for a
month.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all very fine,” said Billy. “But giving a thing a long name doesn’t
make it any better.”
</p>
<p>
“H’sh!” said the troop horse. “I think I understand what Two Tails means.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll understand better in a minute,” said Two Tails angrily. “Now you just
explain to me why you don’t like this!”
</p>
<p>
He began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.
</p>
<p>
“Stop that!” said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could hear them
stamp and shiver. An elephant’s trumpeting is always nasty, especially on a
dark night.
</p>
<p>
“I shan’t stop,” said Two Tails. “Won’t you explain that, please? Hhrrmph!
Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!” Then he stopped suddenly, and I heard a little whimper
in the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last. She knew as well as I
did that if there is one thing in the world the elephant is more afraid of than
another it is a little barking dog. So she stopped to bully Two Tails in his
pickets, and yapped round his big feet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. “Go
away, little dog!” he said. “Don’t snuff at my ankles, or I’ll kick at you.
Good little dog—nice little doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast!
Oh, why doesn’t someone take her away? She’ll bite me in a minute.”
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me,” said Billy to the troop horse, “that our friend Two Tails is
afraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I’ve kicked
across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.”
</p>
<p>
I whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose, and
told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I never let her
know that I understood beast talk, or she would have taken all sorts of
liberties. So I buttoned her into the breast of my overcoat, and Two Tails
shuffled and stamped and growled to himself.
</p>
<p>
“Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!” he said. “It runs in our family. Now,
where has that nasty little beast gone to?”
</p>
<p>
I heard him feeling about with his trunk.
</p>
<p>
“We all seem to be affected in various ways,” he went on, blowing his nose.
“Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.”
</p>
<p>
“Not alarmed, exactly,” said the troop-horse, “but it made me feel as though I
had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don’t begin again.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad dreams
in the night.”
</p>
<p>
“It is very lucky for us that we haven’t all got to fight in the same way,”
said the troop-horse.
</p>
<p>
“What I want to know,” said the young mule, who had been quiet for a long
time—“what I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.”
</p>
<p>
“Because we’re told to,” said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.
</p>
<p>
“Orders,” said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.
</p>
<p>
“Hukm hai!” (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two Tails and
the bullocks repeated, “Hukm hai!”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but who gives the orders?” said the recruit-mule.
</p>
<p>
“The man who walks at your head—Or sits on your back—Or holds the nose rope—Or
twists your tail,” said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel and the
bullocks one after the other.
</p>
<p>
“But who gives them the orders?”
</p>
<p>
“Now you want to know too much, young un,” said Billy, “and that is one way of
getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your head and ask no
questions.”
</p>
<p>
“He’s quite right,” said Two Tails. “I can’t always obey, because I’m betwixt
and between. But Billy’s right. Obey the man next to you who gives the order,
or you’ll stop all the battery, besides getting a thrashing.”
</p>
<p>
The gun-bullocks got up to go. “Morning is coming,” they said. “We will go back
to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and we are not very
clever. But still, we are the only people to-night who have not been afraid.
Good-night, you brave people.”
</p>
<p>
Nobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation, “Where’s
that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.”
</p>
<p>
“Here I am,” yapped Vixen, “under the gun tail with my man. You big, blundering
beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man’s very angry.”
</p>
<p>
“Phew!” said the bullocks. “He must be white!”
</p>
<p>
“Of course he is,” said Vixen. “Do you suppose I’m looked after by a black
bullock-driver?”
</p>
<p>
“Huah! Ouach! Ugh!” said the bullocks. “Let us get away quickly.”
</p>
<p>
They plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke on the
pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.
</p>
<p>
“Now you have done it,” said Billy calmly. “Don’t struggle. You’re hung up till
daylight. What on earth’s the matter?”
</p>
<p>
The bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle give, and
pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and nearly fell down in
the mud, grunting savagely.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll break your necks in a minute,” said the troop-horse. “What’s the matter
with white men? I live with ’em.”
</p>
<p>
“They—eat—us! Pull!” said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a twang, and
they lumbered off together.
</p>
<p>
I never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen. We eat
beef—a thing that no cattle-driver touches—and of course the cattle do not like
it.
</p>
<p>
“May I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who’d have thought of two big lumps
like those losing their heads?” said Billy.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind. I’m going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I know, have
things in their pockets,” said the troop-horse.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll leave you, then. I can’t say I’m over-fond of ’em myself. Besides, white
men who haven’t a place to sleep in are more than likely to be thieves, and
I’ve a good deal of Government property on my back. Come along, young un, and
we’ll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia! See you on parade to-morrow,
I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!—try to control your feelings, won’t you?
Good-night, Two Tails! If you pass us on the ground tomorrow, don’t trumpet. It
spoils our formation.”
</p>
<p>
Billy the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old campaigner, as
the troop-horse’s head came nuzzling into my breast, and I gave him biscuits,
while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog, told him fibs about the scores
of horses that she and I kept.
</p>
<p>
“I’m coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,” she said. “Where will you
be?”
</p>
<p>
“On the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my troop,
little lady,” he said politely. “Now I must go back to Dick. My tail’s all
muddy, and he’ll have two hours’ hard work dressing me for parade.”
</p>
<p>
The big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon, and
Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of Afghanistan,
with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great diamond star in the
center. The first part of the review was all sunshine, and the regiments went
by in wave upon wave of legs all moving together, and guns all in a line, till
our eyes grew dizzy. Then the cavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter
of “Bonnie Dundee,” and Vixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The
second squadron of the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his
tail like spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one
back, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly as
waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two other
elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while twenty yoke of
oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and they looked rather
stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy the mule carried himself
as though he commanded all the troops, and his harness was oiled and polished
till it winked. I gave a cheer all by myself for Billy the mule, but he never
looked right or left.
</p>
<p>
The rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see what the
troops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the plain, and were
spreading out into a line. That line grew and grew and grew till it was
three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing—one solid wall of men, horses,
and guns. Then it came on straight toward the Viceroy and the Amir, and as it
got nearer the ground began to shake, like the deck of a steamer when the
engines are going fast.
</p>
<p>
Unless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect this
steady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they know it is
only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he had not shown the shadow
of a sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his eyes began to get
bigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his horse’s neck and looked
behind him. For a minute it seemed as though he were going to draw his sword
and slash his way out through the English men and women in the carriages at the
back. Then the advance stopped dead, the ground stood still, the whole line
saluted, and thirty bands began to play all together. That was the end of the
review, and the regiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry
band struck up with—
</p>
<p >
The animals went in two by two,<br>
    Hurrah!<br>
The animals went in two by two,<br>
The elephant and the battery mul’,<br>
and they all got into the Ark<br>
    For to get out of the rain!
</p>
<p>
Then I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had come
down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said he, “in what manner was this wonderful thing done?”
</p>
<p>
And the officer answered, “An order was given, and they obeyed.”
</p>
<p>
“But are the beasts as wise as the men?” said the chief.
</p>
<p>
“They obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he obeys his
driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his lieutenant, and the
lieutenant his captain, and the captain his major, and the major his colonel,
and the colonel his brigadier commanding three regiments, and the brigadier the
general, who obeys the Viceroy, who is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is
done.”
</p>
<p>
“Would it were so in Afghanistan!” said the chief, “for there we obey only our
own wills.”
</p>
<p>
“And for that reason,” said the native officer, twirling his mustache, “your
Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our Viceroy.”
